# How can I use the command line to compress and edit files with sed and zip?
// plain

The command line can be used to compress and edit files with sed and zip.

Sed is a stream editor used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). Zip is a file format used for file compression and archiving.

To use sed and zip with the command line, the following example can be used:

```
zip -r myzipfile.zip myfile.txt
sed -i 's/old/new/g' myfile.txt
zip -u myzipfile.zip myfile.txt
```

This example will compress the file `myfile.txt` into a zip file called `myzipfile.zip`, then use sed to replace `old` with `new` in `myfile.txt`, and finally update the `myzipfile.zip` file with the modified `myfile.txt`.

The parts of the example code are as follows:

1. `zip -r myzipfile.zip myfile.txt`: This command creates a zip file called `myzipfile.zip` containing the file `myfile.txt`.
2. `sed -i 's/old/new/g' myfile.txt`: This command uses sed to replace `old` with `new` in `myfile.txt`.
3. `zip -u myzipfile.zip myfile.txt`: This command updates `myzipfile.zip` with the modified `myfile.txt`.
