# How can I use the sed command in the Ubuntu command line interface?
// plain

The `sed` command is a powerful tool in the Ubuntu command line interface (CLI) for text manipulation. It is used to search, find and replace text within files. Here is an example of how to use `sed` to find and replace text in a file:

```
# Search for "text" and replace with "newtext"
sed -i 's/text/newtext/g' filename
```

This command will search for the text "text" in the file `filename` and replace it with "newtext".

The `sed` command has several parts:
* `-i`: This is a flag that tells `sed` to make the changes in-place to the file.
* `s`: This is the search and replace command.
* `text`: This is the text to be searched for.
* `newtext`: This is the text to replace the found text with.
* `g`: This is a flag that tells `sed` to replace all occurrences of the found text.
* `filename`: This is the name of the file to be searched.
