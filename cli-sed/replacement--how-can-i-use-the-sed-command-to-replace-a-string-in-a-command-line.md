How can I use the sed command to replace a string in a command line?
// plain

The `sed` command can be used to replace a string in a command line. To do so, you need to use the `-i` option and specify the string to be replaced. For example, to replace the string `foo` with the string `bar` in the command line `echo foo`, you would use the following command:

```
sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' echo foo
```

This will output `echo bar`, indicating that the string `foo` has been successfully replaced with `bar`.

The command consists of several parts:

* `sed`: The command to invoke the stream editor.
* `-i`: The option to edit the specified file in-place.
* `s/foo/bar/g`: The substitution command, which tells `sed` to replace all occurrences of `foo` with `bar`.
* `echo foo`: The command line to be edited.
