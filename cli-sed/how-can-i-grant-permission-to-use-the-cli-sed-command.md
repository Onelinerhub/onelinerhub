# How can I grant permission to use the CLI sed command?
// plain

To grant permission to use the CLI sed command, you can use the `chmod` command. This command lets you set the permissions for the user, group, and other users.

For example, to grant permission to the user to use the sed command, you can run the following command:

```
chmod u+x sed
```

This command will grant the user execute permission for the `sed` command.

You can also grant permission to the group and other users. To do this, you can run the following command:

```
chmod g+x sed
chmod o+x sed
```

This will grant execute permission to the group and other users.

## Code explanation

- `chmod`: This is the command used to change the permissions of a file or directory.
- `u+x`: This grants execute permission to the user.
- `g+x`: This grants execute permission to the group.
