# How can I use CLI sed to automate Jenkins tasks?
// plain

Sed is a powerful command line tool that can be used to automate Jenkins tasks. It can be used to search and replace strings, extract specific lines from a file, and perform basic text transformations.

For example, the following command can be used to replace the string "oldstring" with "newstring" in a file called "myfile.txt":

```
sed -i 's/oldstring/newstring/g' myfile.txt
```

This command will search for every occurrence of "oldstring" in the file and replace it with "newstring".

It is also possible to use sed to extract specific lines from a file. The following command will extract lines 3 to 8 from a file called "myfile.txt":

```
sed -n '3,8p' myfile.txt
```

This command will print out lines 3 to 8 from the file.

Sed also has the capability to perform basic text transformations such as changing case, removing whitespace, and adding prefixes and suffixes to lines. For example, the following command can be used to add the prefix "prefix_" to every line in a file called "myfile.txt":

```
sed 's/^/prefix_/' myfile.txt
```

This command will add the prefix "prefix_" to the beginning of every line in the file.

Sed can be used for a variety of tasks in Jenkins, such as modifying configuration files, extracting data from log files, and performing basic text transformations.
