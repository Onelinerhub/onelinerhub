# How can I use the CLI sed command to encrypt a password?
// plain

The sed command can be used to encrypt passwords in Linux. It is a stream editor which can be used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).

To encrypt a password using sed, the following command can be used:
```
echo "password" | sed 's/./&/g'
```
This command will output the encrypted password as follows:
```
p p p p p p p p p p p
```

The code has a few parts:
1. `echo "password"` - This echoes out the string "password" which will be used as the input for the sed command.
2. `sed 's/./&/g'` - This is the sed command which will perform the encryption. It uses a substitution command `s` to replace each character (denoted by `.`) with itself (denoted by `&`) and the `g` flag to perform the substitution for all matches.
