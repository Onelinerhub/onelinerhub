How do I create a new file using a CLI command?
// plain

To create a new file using a CLI command, you can use the `touch` command. This command will create a new, empty file. For example, to create a file called `myfile.txt`, you would enter the following command:

```
touch myfile.txt
```

This command will not output anything, but if you check the directory for the file, it will be there.

The `touch` command has the following parts:

* `touch`: The command itself.
* `myfile.txt`: The name of the file to be created.

For more information about the `touch` command, you can refer to the [GNU Coreutils manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/touch-invocation.html).
