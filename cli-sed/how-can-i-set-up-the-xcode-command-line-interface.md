# How can I set up the Xcode command line interface?
// plain

1. To set up the Xcode command line interface, you must first install Xcode from the Mac App Store. After installing Xcode, open it and go to Preferences > Downloads. Here, select the Command Line Tools option and click Install.

2. Once the Command Line Tools are installed, you can open Terminal and type `xcode-select --install` to verify the installation.

3. After the installation is verified, you can use the `xcodebuild` command to build and run your Xcode projects from the command line. For example, to build an Xcode project located in the current directory, you can type the following command:

```
xcodebuild -project MyProject.xcodeproj
```

4. You can also use the `xcodebuild` command to run tests, run specific targets, and generate code coverage reports. For example, to run tests in the `MyProjectTests` target, you can type the following command:

```
xcodebuild -project MyProject.xcodeproj -scheme MyProjectTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 11' test
```

5. You can also use the `xcodebuild` command to generate a code coverage report. To generate a code coverage report, you can type the following command:

```
xcodebuild -project MyProject.xcodeproj -scheme MyProjectTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 11' -enableCodeCoverage YES test
```

6. After running the command, the code coverage report will be generated in the `MyProject.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes` directory.

7. For more information on the `xcodebuild` command and other Xcode command line tools, please refer to the [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_release_notes).
