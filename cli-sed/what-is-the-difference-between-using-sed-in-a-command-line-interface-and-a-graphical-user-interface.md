// plain

The difference between using sed in a command line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) is that the CLI version requires users to type in commands to initiate actions, while the GUI version provides a graphical environment that allows users to interact with the program using a mouse and keyboard.

In the CLI version, users can use sed to search for patterns and perform text transformations in a single command. For example, the following command would replace all instances of the word "cat" with the word "dog":
```
sed 's/cat/dog/g'
```

In the GUI version, users can use a graphical editor to search for patterns and perform text transformations. For example, a user can use a search and replace feature to replace all instances of the word "cat" with the word "dog".

The following are the main differences between using sed in a CLI and GUI:

* CLI version requires users to type in commands to initiate actions, while the GUI version provides a graphical environment.
* CLI version allows users to perform text transformations in a single command, while the GUI version requires users to use a graphical editor.
