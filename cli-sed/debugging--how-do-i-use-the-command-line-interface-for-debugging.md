How do I use the command line interface for debugging?
// plain

Debugging with the command line interface is a powerful way to identify and fix errors in your code. It involves running your code line by line and examining the output to identify and fix any issues that arise.

To begin debugging with the command line interface, you must first locate the source of the error. This can be done by examining the error message or by adding print statements to your code to track the flow of execution.

For example, let's say we have the following code:

```
def foo(x):
    return x + 1

y = foo(2)
print(y)
```

If we run this code, we should expect to see the output `3`. However, if we get an error message, we can use the command line interface to debug it.

First, we can add a `print` statement to the beginning of the function to track the flow of execution:

```
def foo(x):
    print('foo called')
    return x + 1

y = foo(2)
print(y)
```

Now, if we run the code, we should see the output `foo called` followed by `3`. If we don't see the `foo called` output, we know that the function is not being called.

Once we have identified the source of the error, we can use the command line interface to step through the code line by line and examine the output at each step. This allows us to identify exactly where the error is occurring and how to fix it.

The command line interface is a powerful tool for debugging code and can be used to quickly identify and fix errors.

## List of Code Parts with Detailed Explanation

1. `def foo(x):` - This is a function definition. It defines a function called `foo` that takes one argument, `x`.
2. `return x + 1` - This is a return statement. It returns the value of `x` plus 1.
3. `y = foo(2)` - This is an assignment statement. It assigns the return value of the `foo` function (with argument `2`) to the variable `y`.
4. `print(y)` - This is a print statement. It prints the value of the variable `y` to the console.
