# How do I use a golf club with the command line interface (CLI) sed program?
// plain

The `sed` command line interface (CLI) program is a powerful text-processing utility that can be used to manipulate text files. It can be used to search and replace text, delete lines, and extract text from files.

To use `sed` to manipulate a golf club file, the following command can be used:

```
sed 's/golf/club/g' golf.txt
```

This command will search for the word `golf` in the file `golf.txt` and replace it with `club`.

The following parts are included in the command above:

* `sed` - the command line program used to manipulate text
* `s/golf/club/g` - the search and replace command, where `golf` is the text to be searched for and `club` is the text to be replaced
* `golf.txt` - the file that will be manipulated

The output of the command above will be the contents of `golf.txt` with all occurrences of `golf` replaced with `club`.
