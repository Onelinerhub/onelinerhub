# How can I use CLI sed to authenticate to AWS?
// plain

You cannot use CLI sed to authenticate to AWS. However, you can use the AWS CLI to authenticate and manage your AWS services. To authenticate, you will need to install the AWS CLI and configure it with your AWS access key and secret key.

For example, you can use the following command to configure it:

```
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

This command will create a configuration file in your home directory at `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` with the provided access key and secret key.

## Code explanation


1. `aws configure` - This command will prompt you for your AWS access key and secret key.
2. `AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` - This is the AWS access key you need to provide.
3. `AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY` - This is the AWS secret key you need to provide.
4. `Default region name [None]: us-east-1` - This is the region name you need to provide.
5. `Default output format [None]: json` - This is the output format you need to provide.
