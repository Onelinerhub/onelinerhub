// plain

Sed keybindings can be used in the command line interface to quickly perform a variety of text-editing tasks. Sed is a stream editor that can be used to search, find and replace patterns within text files. The following example code demonstrates how to use sed keybindings in the command line interface.

```
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

This command will replace all occurrences of the word 'old' with the word 'new' within the file file.txt.

The parts of this command are as follows:

- `sed`: The command used to call the sed stream editor.
- `-i`: The option used to edit the file in place.
- `s/old/new/g`: The search and replace pattern. This will search for the word 'old' and replace it with the word 'new'.
- `file.txt`: The name of the file to be edited.
