# How can I use CLI sed and Yarn together to develop software?
// plain

You can use CLI sed and Yarn together to develop software by combining the two tools. For example, you can use `sed` to search and replace text in files and `yarn` to install and manage dependencies.

To get started, you can install `yarn` using the command `npm install -g yarn`.

Then, you can use `sed` to search and replace text in files. For example, to replace the text `foo` with `bar` in a file called `example.txt`, you can use the command:

```
sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' example.txt
```

You can also use `yarn` to install and manage dependencies. For example, to install the package `lodash`, you can use the command:

```
yarn add lodash
```

You can also use `yarn` to run scripts defined in your `package.json` file. For example, to run the script `test`, you can use the command:

```
yarn run test
```

By combining the two tools, you can use `sed` to search and replace text in files and `yarn` to install and manage dependencies and run scripts.
