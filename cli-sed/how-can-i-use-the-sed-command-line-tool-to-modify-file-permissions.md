# How can I use the sed command line tool to modify file permissions?
// plain

Using the `sed` command line tool, you can modify file permissions by using the `chmod` command. For example, if you wanted to give read and write permissions to all users for a file named `test.txt`, you could use the following code:

```
sed -i 's/test.txt/chmod 666 test.txt/g'
```

This would change the permissions of `test.txt` to `666`, giving read and write permissions to all users.

The code can be broken down as follows:

* `sed` - the command line tool used for modifying file permissions
* `-i` - the option used to edit the file in place
* `s/test.txt/chmod 666 test.txt/g` - the substitution command, which replaces `test.txt` with `chmod 666 test.txt`
