# How do I use Amazon Redshift?
// plain

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, cloud-based data warehouse service that makes it easy to analyze large amounts of data quickly. It is based on PostgreSQL and can be used for a variety of data analysis tasks.

To use Amazon Redshift, you first need to create a cluster. This can be done through the AWS Management Console. Once the cluster is set up, you can connect to it using a SQL client such as SQL Workbench.

Once connected, you can run SQL queries to analyze your data. For example, you can use the following query to get the top 10 customers by sales:

```
SELECT customer_name, SUM(sales)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The output of the query would look something like this:

```
customer_name	sum(sales)
John Doe	     20000
Jane Doe	     18000
...		         ...
```

You can also use Amazon Redshift to create tables, views, and other database objects. Additionally, you can use it to create user-defined functions and stored procedures.
