# How can I use Amazon Redshift to store and query data from a book?
// plain

Amazon Redshift is a cloud-based data warehouse service that can be used to store and query data from a book. It allows users to easily store and analyze large amounts of structured and semi-structured data. To use Amazon Redshift to store and query data from a book, you will need to first create a database table to store the data. Then, you can use SQL commands to query the data from the table.

For example, the following code will create a table called ‘book_data’ and store data from a book in it:

```
CREATE TABLE book_data
(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    page_count INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

To query data from the table, you can use the following SQL query:

```
SELECT * FROM book_data WHERE page_count > 200;
```

The code above will return all books with more than 200 pages.

## Code explanation

* `CREATE TABLE book_data` - This command creates a table called ‘book_data’ in the database.
* `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` - This command specifies that the ‘id’ column is an integer and is the primary key of the table.
* `title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL` - This command specifies that the ‘title’ column is a variable-length character string with a maximum length of 100 characters and cannot be null.
* `author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL` - This command specifies that the ‘author’ column is a variable-length character string with a maximum length of 100 characters and cannot be null.
* `page_count INTEGER NOT NULL` - This command specifies that the ‘page_count’ column is an integer and cannot be null.
* `SELECT * FROM book_data WHERE page_count > 200` - This command queries the table ‘book_data’ and returns all books with more than 200 pages.
