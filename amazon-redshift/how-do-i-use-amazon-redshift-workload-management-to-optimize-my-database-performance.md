# How do I use Amazon Redshift Workload Management to optimize my database performance?
// plain

Amazon Redshift Workload Management (WLM) is a feature that allows you to prioritize and manage concurrent queries and workloads in Amazon Redshift. It enables you to manage the resources used by queries and workloads, and to optimize performance.

Using WLM, you can assign queries to different queues based on their priority and resource requirements. For example, you can create a queue for your most important queries and assign it the highest priority and the most resources.

You can also set concurrency limits for each queue, which will limit the number of queries that can run concurrently in that queue. This ensures that the resources are not over-utilized and that queries in the higher priority queues get the resources they need.

You can also set memory limits for each queue, which will limit the amount of memory that queries in that queue can use. This helps to ensure that queries in the higher priority queues get the memory they need.

Example code to set up a queue with the highest priority and the most resources in Amazon Redshift:

```
CREATE QUEUE my_important_queue
WITH
  concurrency_level = 10,
  memory_limit_mb = 10000,
  priority = 1;
```

This creates a queue called `my_important_queue` with a concurrency limit of 10, a memory limit of 10,000 MB, and a priority of 1.
