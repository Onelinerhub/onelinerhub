Amazon Redshift Utils is a set of utilities that can be used to optimize your database.

1. **VACUUM**: Vacuuming is a process that reclaims disk space and re-sorts rows to optimize query performance. To use VACUUM, execute the following command:
```
VACUUM [VERBOSE] [FULL] [ANALYZE] [table_name]
```
2. **ANALYZE**: Analyzing computes statistics about the distribution of data in tables and columns, which helps the query optimizer generate more efficient query plans. To use ANALYZE, execute the following command:
```
ANALYZE [VERBOSE] [table_name]
```
3. **REINDEX**: Reindexing is a process that rebuilds indexes to improve query performance. To use REINDEX, execute the following command:
```
REINDEX [VERBOSE] [table_name]
```
