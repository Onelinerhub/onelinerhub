# How can I use Amazon Web Services to create a zombie game?
// plain

Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be used to create a zombie game. The following steps can be taken to do so:

1. Create an Amazon GameLift server fleet using Amazon EC2 instances. This will allow you to host the game and manage the game session.

2. Use Amazon DynamoDB to store game data and Amazon S3 to store game assets such as images.

3. Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda to create a REST API for the game. This will allow users to interact with the game over the internet.

4. Use Amazon Cognito to authenticate users. This will allow you to track user identities and store user data securely.

5. Use Amazon CloudFront to deliver game assets quickly to users around the world.

6. Use Amazon Machine Learning to create an AI for the zombies. This will allow the zombies to act intelligently and make the game more challenging.

7. Use Amazon Pinpoint to send notifications to users when new content is available or when they have achieved something in the game.

```
Example code block

// Create an Amazon GameLift server fleet
CreateGameLiftFleetRequest request = new CreateGameLiftFleetRequest()
    .withName("MyFleet")
    .withBuildId("MyBuildId")
    .withInstanceType("m4.large")
    .withMaxSize(2)
    .withMinSize(2);

CreateGameLiftFleetResult result = gameLiftClient.createGameLiftFleet(request);

System.out.println("FleetId: " + result.getFleetId());
```

## Output example

```
FleetId: fleet-abc123
```
