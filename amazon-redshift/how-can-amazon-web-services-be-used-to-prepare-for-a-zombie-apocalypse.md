# How can Amazon Web Services be used to prepare for a zombie apocalypse?
// plain

Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be used to prepare for a zombie apocalypse in a variety of ways. First, AWS can be used to store large amounts of data such as maps and survivor locations. This data can be accessed quickly and securely, allowing for quick decisions and actions to be taken. Additionally, AWS can be used to create a distributed computing network that can be used to quickly process large amounts of data. This can be used to detect zombie movement patterns and plan out defensive and offensive strategies.

AWS can also be used to create a communication network that can be used to coordinate between survivors. This could be done using Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). For example, the following code can be used to create an SQS queue and an SNS topic:

```
# Create an SQS queue
import boto3

sqs = boto3.resource('sqs')

queue = sqs.create_queue(QueueName='zombie_alerts')

# Create an SNS topic
sns = boto3.resource('sns')

topic = sns.create_topic(Name='zombie_alerts')
```

Finally, AWS can be used to store and process large amounts of video and audio data. This can be used to detect zombie presence and movements in real-time.

- Create an SQS queue: `sqs = boto3.resource('sqs'); queue = sqs.create_queue(QueueName='zombie_alerts')`
- Create an SNS topic: `sns = boto3.resource('sns'); topic = sns.create_topic(Name='zombie_alerts')`
