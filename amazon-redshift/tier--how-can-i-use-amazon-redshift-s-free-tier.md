How can I use Amazon Redshift's free tier?
// plain

Amazon Redshift's free tier allows users to try out the service for free. To use this free tier, users must sign up for an AWS account. Once the account is created, users can navigate to the Amazon Redshift console and select the "Try Amazon Redshift for Free" option.

The free tier includes a single-node cluster with 160GB of storage and 2 million I/O operations. Users can also use the free tier to experiment with features such as query optimization and columnar storage.

Below is an example of how to create a free tier cluster using the AWS CLI:

```
$ aws redshift create-cluster --cluster-type single-node --node-type dc2.large --cluster-identifier my-free-cluster --master-username admin --master-user-password mypassword
```

This command will create a single-node Redshift cluster with a dc2.large node type and the specified username and password.

## Code explanation


* `create-cluster`: This is the command used to create a new Redshift cluster.
* `--cluster-type`: This option specifies the type of cluster to create. In this case, it is set to `single-node`.
* `--node-type`: This option specifies the type of node to use in the cluster. In this case, it is set to `dc2.large`.
* `--cluster-identifier`: This option specifies the name of the cluster.
* `--master-username`: This option specifies the username for the cluster's master user.
* `--master-user-password`: This option specifies the password for the cluster's master user.

The output from this command will be a JSON object containing information about the newly created cluster, such as its endpoint and status.

For more information on using the free tier, please see the [Amazon Redshift documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#rs-working-with-clusters-free-tier).
