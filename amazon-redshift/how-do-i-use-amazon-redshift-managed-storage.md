# How do I use Amazon Redshift managed storage?
// plain

Amazon Redshift managed storage is a cloud-based data warehouse service that can be used for large-scale data analysis. It is based on PostgreSQL and provides a SQL interface for querying and managing data. To use Amazon Redshift managed storage, you need to create a cluster, which is a collection of nodes that store and process data.

You can create a cluster using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the Amazon Redshift API. Once the cluster is created, you can load data into it using the COPY command. The following is an example of the COPY command used to load data from an Amazon S3 bucket into a Redshift cluster:

```
COPY table_name
FROM 's3://bucket_name/file_name'
CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=<your_access_key_id>;aws_secret_access_key=<your_secret_access_key>'
DELIMITER ',';
```

Once the data is loaded into the cluster, you can use SQL queries to analyze it and generate insights. The following is an example of a SQL query used to count the number of records in a table:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name
```

The output of this query would be a single number representing the number of records in the table.

You can also use Amazon Redshift managed storage to back up and restore data. You can create a snapshot of your cluster using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon Redshift API. You can then use this snapshot to restore your cluster to a previous state.

## List of Code Parts

1. `COPY table_name`: This command is used to copy data from an Amazon S3 bucket into a Redshift cluster.
2. `FROM 's3://bucket_name/file_name'`: This specifies the Amazon S3 bucket and file name from which the data will be copied.
3. `CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=<your_access_key_id>;aws_secret_access_key=<your_secret_access_key>'`: This specifies the AWS access key ID and secret access key that will be used to authenticate the copy operation.
4. `DELIMITER ',';`: This specifies the delimiter that will be used to separate the data fields in the file.
5. `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name`: This command is used to count the number of records in a table.
