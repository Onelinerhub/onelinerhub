How do I use Amazon RDS?
// plain

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a cloud-based platform for managing relational databases. It is a fully managed service that provides a cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.

To use Amazon RDS, you will need to create a database instance and configure it to meet your requirements. You can do this through the Amazon RDS console, or via the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

Example code to create a database using the AWS CLI:

```
aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
--allocated-storage 10 --db-instance-class db.t2.micro \
--engine mysql --master-username admin --master-user-password mypassword
```

The output of this command will be a JSON object with the details of the newly created database instance.

## Code explanation


1. `aws rds create-db-instance`: This is the command to create a new instance on Amazon RDS.
2. `--db-instance-identifier mydbinstance`: This is the name of the new instance.
3. `--allocated-storage 10`: This is the amount of storage allocated to the instance.
4. `--db-instance-class db.t2.micro`: This is the type of instance to be created (in this case, a t2.micro instance).
5. `--engine mysql`: This is the type of database engine to be used (in this case, MySQL).
6. `--master-username admin`: This is the username of the master user for the instance.
7. `--master-user-password mypassword`: This is the password of the master user for the instance.
