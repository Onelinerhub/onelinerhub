# How do I use Amazon Redshift to answer specific questions?
// plain

Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse solution that enables users to analyze large datasets. It can be used to answer specific questions by running queries against the data. For example, the following query can be used to find the total number of orders placed in a given month:

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31';
```

## Output example

```
COUNT(*)
25000
```

The query consists of the following parts:
1. SELECT - This specifies the columns that should be returned by the query. In this case, COUNT(*) is used to get the total number of orders.
2. FROM - This specifies the table that should be queried. In this case, the orders table is used.
3. WHERE - This specifies the conditions that should be used to filter the results. In this case, the order_date column is used to filter the results to orders placed between the given dates.
