Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. It can be used to learn on Udemy by taking courses related to data warehousing and analytics. For example, a course on Amazon Redshift could teach users how to use Redshift to query data, create tables, and improve query performance.

Below is an example of a SQL query that can be used to query data in Amazon Redshift:

```
SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE condition1 = 'value1'
AND condition2 = 'value2'
```

This query will return all rows from the table `my_table` where `condition1` is equal to `value1` and `condition2` is equal to `value2`.

The following list explains the parts of the query:

- `SELECT`: This is the keyword used to specify which columns you want to return from the table.
- `*`: This is a wildcard used to select all columns from the table.
- `FROM`: This is the keyword used to specify which table you want to query.
- `my_table`: This is the name of the table you want to query.
- `WHERE`: This is the keyword used to specify which conditions must be met for a row to be returned.
- `condition1` and `condition2`: These are the names of the columns you want to use for the conditions.
- `value1` and `value2`: These are the values that must be matched for a row to be returned.
