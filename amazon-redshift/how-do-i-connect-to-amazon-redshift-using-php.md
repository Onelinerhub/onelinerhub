# How do I connect to Amazon Redshift using PHP?
// plain

To connect to Amazon Redshift using PHP, you will need to use the PHP PostgreSQL library. This library provides functions that allow you to connect to PostgreSQL databases, such as Amazon Redshift.

The following is an example of how to connect to a Redshift database using PHP:

```php
<?php
$host        = "examplecluster.cluster-cxz123.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com";
$port        = "5439";
$dbname      = "dev";
$credentials = "awsuser";

$pg_conn = pg_connect("host=$host port=$port dbname=$dbname user=$credentials");

if (!$pg_conn) {
    echo "Error : Unable to open database\n";
} else {
    echo "Opened database successfully\n";
}
?>
```

The output of the above code will be:

```
Opened database successfully
```

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. `$host` - The hostname of the Redshift cluster.
2. `$port` - The port number of the Redshift cluster.
3. `$dbname` - The name of the database to connect to.
4. `$credentials` - The credentials used to authenticate to the database.
5. `pg_connect()` - The function used to connect to the database.
6. `if (!$pg_conn)` - The condition to check if the connection was successful.
7. `echo "Error : Unable to open database\n"` - The message to display if the connection was unsuccessful.
8. `echo "Opened database successfully\n"` - The message to display if the connection was successful.
