# How can I use Amazon Redshift SQL to achieve my desired results?
// plain

Amazon Redshift SQL can be used to achieve desired results by writing SQL queries. For example, the following SQL query can be used to select all customers with their respective orders from the orders table:

```
SELECT c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

The output of this query would be a table with two columns, one for the customer name and one for the order ID.

The code can be broken down into the following parts:
1. SELECT - This is used to specify which columns from the table should be returned.
2. FROM - This clause specifies which table or tables to select from.
3. INNER JOIN - This clause is used to join two tables together on a specific condition.
4. ON - This clause specifies the condition that must be met for the join to occur.
