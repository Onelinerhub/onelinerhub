# How do I use Amazon AWS X-Ray to debug my application?
// plain

Amazon AWS X-Ray is a distributed tracing system that helps you debug your application. It allows you to analyze and debug distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture.

To use Amazon AWS X-Ray, you first need to install the AWS X-Ray SDK into your application. The SDK allows you to instrument your code so that it can send trace data to the X-Ray service.

Once you have the SDK installed, you can begin instrumenting code in your application. This involves adding annotations and subsegments to your code to capture information about the application's execution.

For example, the following code uses the X-Ray SDK to add an annotation to the application's trace:
```
import aws_xray_sdk
xray_recorder = aws_xray_sdk.core.xray_recorder

@xray_recorder.capture('my_function')
def my_function():
    # Do something
    xray_recorder.put_annotation('my_annotation', 'some_value')
```

You can then view the trace data in the X-Ray console. This allows you to view the trace data for your application and identify any potential issues.

You can also use X-Ray to analyze performance bottlenecks and identify areas of your application that could be improved.
