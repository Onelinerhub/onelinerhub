# How can I use Amazon Redshift to perform an Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) operation?
// plain

Amazon Redshift is a cloud-based data warehouse that can be used to perform Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) operations. ELT is a process of extracting data from a source system, loading it into a target system, and then transforming it into a format that is more suitable for analysis.

To perform an ELT operation with Amazon Redshift, you can use the COPY command to extract data from a source system and load it into the target system. The following example code will extract data from an Amazon S3 bucket and load it into a table in Amazon Redshift:

```
COPY my_table
FROM 's3://my-bucket/my-data.csv'
CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=<YourAccessKey>;aws_secret_access_key=<YourSecretKey>'
CSV
IGNOREHEADER 1
```

Once the data is loaded into the target system, it can be transformed using SQL. The following example code will add a new column to the table with a calculated value:

```
ALTER TABLE my_table
ADD COLUMN new_column INTEGER

UPDATE my_table
SET new_column = (column1 + column2) * column3
```

In addition to the COPY and SQL commands, Amazon Redshift also provides a set of built-in functions and stored procedures that can be used to perform more complex transformations.
