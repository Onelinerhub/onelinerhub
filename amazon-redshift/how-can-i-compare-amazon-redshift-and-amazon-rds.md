# How can I compare Amazon Redshift and Amazon RDS?
// plain

Amazon Redshift and Amazon RDS are two of Amazon Web Services' (AWS) database services. Redshift is a data warehouse service that is used for large-scale data analysis, while RDS is a relational database service that is used for more traditional database operations.

The main difference between Redshift and RDS is the way they store data. Redshift stores data in a columnar format, which is optimized for analyzing large datasets. RDS stores data in a relational format, which is better for transactional operations.

A comparison of the two services can be done with the following example. The following code will create a table in Redshift and RDS, and then query the tables to compare the performance of the two services:

```
-- Create table in Redshift
CREATE TABLE redshift_table (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Create table in RDS
CREATE TABLE rds_table (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Query tables
SELECT * FROM redshift_table
SELECT * FROM rds_table
```

The output of the code will be two tables, one from Redshift and one from RDS. Comparing the two tables will allow you to see the differences in performance between the two services.

In summary, the main difference between Amazon Redshift and Amazon RDS is the way they store data. Redshift is optimized for large-scale data analysis, while RDS is better for transactional operations. Comparing the two services can be done by creating tables in each service and then querying the tables to compare their performance.
