# How can I use the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide to develop a database?
// plain

The Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide is an excellent resource for developing a database. It provides detailed instructions on how to create, manage, and query data using the Redshift database. Here is an example of how to create a table in Redshift:

```
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

This example code creates a table called `mytable` with two columns, `id` and `name`. The `id` column is an integer and is the primary key, meaning it is the unique identifier for each row in the table. The `name` column is a variable-length character string with a maximum of 255 characters.

The Redshift Database Developer Guide also provides instructions on how to write SQL queries, manage users, and configure security settings. Additionally, it includes tutorials and best practices for optimizing performance and scalability.

## Code explanation


- `CREATE TABLE`: Creates a new table in the database.
