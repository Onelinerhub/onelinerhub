Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service. It is designed for large-scale data analysis and enables users to quickly analyze vast amounts of data using standard SQL.

The Amazon Redshift Wiki provides a comprehensive guide to using Amazon Redshift. It covers topics such as creating and managing clusters, loading data, performing queries, and monitoring performance.

To use the Amazon Redshift Wiki, first navigate to the [Amazon Redshift Wiki page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/welcome.html). From here, you can explore the various topics covered in the Wiki.

For example, to learn how to create a cluster, you can click on the **Creating** tab and then select **Creating a Cluster**. This will bring you to a page that provides detailed instructions on how to create a cluster, including example code.

The following example code creates a cluster with two nodes:

```
aws redshift create-cluster
    --node-type dc2.large
    --number-of-nodes 2
    --cluster-type multi-node
```

The output of the command will be a JSON object containing the cluster's information, such as its identifier and endpoint.

The Amazon Redshift Wiki also provides links to additional resources, such as tutorials and best practices, to help you get started with Amazon Redshift.
