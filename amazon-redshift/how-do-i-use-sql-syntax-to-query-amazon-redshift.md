# How do I use SQL syntax to query Amazon Redshift?
// plain

To query Amazon Redshift, you will need to use SQL syntax. The syntax used in Amazon Redshift is based on the ANSI SQL-92 standard.

Here is an example of a SQL query to select all rows from a table called 'customers':
```
SELECT * FROM customers;
```
This query will return all the rows from the customers table.

Here is a breakdown of the code:
* `SELECT` - This clause specifies which columns to select from the table. In this example, the `*` indicates that all columns should be selected.
* `FROM` - This clause specifies which table the data should be selected from. In this example, the table is called `customers`.
