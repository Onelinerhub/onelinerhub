# How can I optimize Amazon Redshift performance?
// plain

1. **Use the right sort key**: The sort key determines how the data is physically stored on disk. Choosing the correct sort key can drastically improve query performance. For example, if you want to query for all customers in a certain state, you should use the state as the sort key.

2. **Use the right distribution style**: Distribution style determines how the data is distributed across the nodes in the cluster. Choosing the right distribution style can help minimize data movement and improve query performance. For example, if you have a table with customer data, you should use the customer ID as the distribution key.

3. **Use the right data types**: Choosing the right data type can reduce storage and improve query performance. For example, if you have a column with numbers, you should use the appropriate integer data type instead of a varchar.

4. **Use the right compression**: Compression can reduce storage and improve query performance. For example, you can use the LZO algorithm to compress text data.

```
ALTER TABLE mytable
ADD COLUMN mycolumn VARCHAR(50)
COMPRESSION LZO;
```

5. **Avoid unnecessary joins**: Joins can be expensive and should be avoided when possible. For example, if you need to query for a customer's address, you should store the address in the same table as the customer data instead of joining two tables.

6. **Use materialized views**: Materialized views can improve query performance by pre-computing expensive queries and storing the results. For example, if you have a query that is used frequently, you can create a materialized view that stores the results of the query.

7. **Use the right hardware**: Choosing the right hardware can improve query performance. For example, you should choose the right type of storage for your workload (SSD or HDD) and the right number of nodes for your cluster.
