# How can I use Amazon Redshift on a medium-sized dataset?
// plain

Using Amazon Redshift on a medium-sized dataset is relatively straightforward. The first step is to create an Amazon Redshift cluster. Once the cluster is created, the user can create a database and load the data into it.

Next, the user can query the data using SQL. Here is an example of a simple query to retrieve all the rows from a table:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

The output of this query will be a result set containing all the rows in the table.

Finally, the user can use the Amazon Redshift console to analyze the data and create visualizations.

## Code explanation


- `SELECT`: This keyword is used to retrieve data from a table.
- `*`: This symbol is used to select all columns from a table.
- `FROM`: This keyword is used to specify the table from which to retrieve data.
