# How do I use Amazon Redshift in a serverless environment?
// plain

Amazon Redshift can be used in a serverless environment by leveraging the Amazon Redshift Data API. The Data API allows you to interact with your Amazon Redshift clusters using HTTP or HTTPS endpoints in a serverless environment. You can use the Data API to execute SQL statements, run Amazon Redshift system commands, and manage transactions.

For example, you can use the Data API to execute a SQL statement to retrieve data from an Amazon Redshift cluster with the following code:

```
import boto3

# Create an Amazon Redshift client
redshift = boto3.client('redshift-data')

# Execute a SQL statement
sql = "SELECT * FROM mytable;"
response = redshift.execute_statement(
    Database='mydb',
    SecretArn='arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:mysecret-abcdef',
    Sql=sql
)
```

The output of this code will be a `StatementExecuteResponse` object that contains the response from the execution of the SQL statement.

The parts of this code are:

1. `boto3`: A Python library used for interacting with AWS services.
2. `redshift`: An Amazon Redshift client created with `boto3`.
3. `sql`: A SQL statement to execute.
4. `response`: The response from executing the SQL statement.
