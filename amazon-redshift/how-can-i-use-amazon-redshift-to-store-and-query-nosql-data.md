# How can I use Amazon Redshift to store and query NoSQL data?
// plain

Amazon Redshift is a cloud-based data warehouse service that can be used to store and query NoSQL data. It supports a variety of NoSQL data types including JSON, XML, and Avro. To store NoSQL data in Redshift, you can use the `COPY` command to load the data from Amazon S3 or DynamoDB.

For example, the following code block loads JSON data from an S3 bucket into a Redshift table:
```
COPY my_table
FROM 's3://my_bucket/my_data.json'
FORMAT AS JSON 'auto';
```

To query the NoSQL data, you can use the `SELECT` statement as you would with any other data type. For example, the following code block retrieves all records from the `my_table` table:
```
SELECT *
FROM my_table;
```

## Code explanation

- `COPY`: loads the data from Amazon S3 or DynamoDB into Redshift
- `FROM`: specifies the source of the data (e.g. S3 bucket)
- `FORMAT AS JSON`: specifies the data type (e.g. JSON)
- `SELECT`: retrieves data from the table
