# How do Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery compare in terms of performance and cost?
// plain

Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery are two popular cloud data warehouse solutions. They both offer high performance and scalability, but there are some differences in terms of performance and cost.

In terms of performance, Amazon Redshift is generally faster than BigQuery due to its columnar storage architecture. Redshift also offers advanced features such as query caching and query optimization, which can further improve performance.

In terms of cost, BigQuery is generally more cost-effective than Redshift. BigQuery charges per query, while Redshift charges per hour of usage. BigQuery also offers discounts for long-running jobs and reserved capacity.

For example, the following code shows how to run a query on BigQuery:

```
SELECT * FROM [my_dataset.my_table]
```

The output of this query will be the contents of the `my_table` table.

In summary, Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery both offer high performance and scalability, but there are some differences in terms of performance and cost. BigQuery is generally more cost-effective, while Redshift is generally faster due to its columnar storage architecture.
