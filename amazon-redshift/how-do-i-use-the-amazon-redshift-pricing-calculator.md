To use the Amazon Redshift pricing calculator, you need to fill out the fields in the calculator with the details of your Redshift cluster.

To begin, you can access the calculator by following this link:

Once you're on the page, you will see a section called "Redshift Pricing Calculator". Here, you can enter the details of your Redshift cluster. You can specify the following parameters:

- **Region:** The geographic region where you want to run your Redshift cluster.
- **Node Type:** The type of compute nodes you want to use.
- **Number of Nodes:** The number of nodes you want to use.
- **Usage Type:** Whether you want to use Redshift for On-Demand or Reserved Instances.

Once you have specified all the parameters, you can click on the "Calculate" button to get an estimate of the cost of running your Redshift cluster.

For example, if you want to use a 4-node dc2.large cluster in the US East (N. Virginia) region on an On-Demand basis, you would enter the following values:

```
Region: US East (N. Virginia)
Node Type: dc2.large
Number of Nodes: 4

```

The calculator will then show an estimated cost of $1,944.00 per month.

This is how you can use the Amazon Redshift pricing calculator.
