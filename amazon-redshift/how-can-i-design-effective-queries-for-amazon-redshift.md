# How can I design effective queries for Amazon Redshift?
// plain

To design effective queries for Amazon Redshift, the following best practices should be followed:

1. Use appropriate sort keys when creating tables. Sort keys allow data to be stored in sorted order, which helps with query performance.

2. Use the correct data types for columns. Choosing the right data type can help reduce the amount of disk space used and improve query performance.

3. Use Vacuum and Analyze to keep statistics up to date. Vacuum and Analyze are essential for query optimization.

4. Use distribution keys to distribute data evenly across nodes. This helps to reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned and improves query performance.

5. Use the right join types. Joins are expensive operations, so it's important to use the right join type for the query.

6. Use the COPY command to load data. The COPY command is the fastest way to load data into Redshift.

7. Use the EXPLAIN command to analyze query plans. EXPLAIN provides insight into how queries are being executed and can help identify areas for improvement.

## Example code

```
SELECT *
FROM table1
JOIN table2
USING (column1)
```
No output.
