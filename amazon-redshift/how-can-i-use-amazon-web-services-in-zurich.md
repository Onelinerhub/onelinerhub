# How can I use Amazon Web Services in Zurich?
// plain

Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be used in Zurich to provide a range of services, including compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, and more.

For example, AWS can be used to create a virtual private cloud (VPC) in Zurich. This will provide a secure environment for hosting applications and services.

To create a VPC in Zurich, you can use the following code:

```
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --region eu-west-1 --availability-zone eu-west-1a
```

This will create a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16 in the eu-west-1 region of Zurich.

Once the VPC is created, you can then create subnets, route tables, and security groups to further configure the VPC. You can also launch EC2 instances into the VPC to host applications and services.
