# How can I handle divide by zero errors when using Amazon Redshift?
// plain

Divide by zero errors occur when attempting to divide a number by zero. When using Amazon Redshift, divide by zero errors can be handled by using the `ISNULL` function. This function can be used to check if the denominator is zero before performing the division.

For example:

```
SELECT CASE WHEN ISNULL(denominator, 0) = 0 THEN 0 ELSE numerator/denominator END AS result
FROM table_name;
```

This code will return 0 if the denominator is 0, and will perform the division if it is not.

Parts of the code:

- `SELECT`: This keyword is used to select the columns from the table that will be used in the query.
- `CASE WHEN`: This statement is used to create a conditional statement. It will check if the denominator is 0.
- `ISNULL`: This function is used to check if the denominator is 0.
- `THEN`: This keyword is used to specify the action that should be taken if the `CASE WHEN` statement is true.
- `ELSE`: This keyword is used to specify the action that should be taken if the `CASE WHEN` statement is false.
- `END`: This keyword is used to close the `CASE WHEN` statement.
- `FROM`: This keyword is used to specify the table that the query will be performed on.
