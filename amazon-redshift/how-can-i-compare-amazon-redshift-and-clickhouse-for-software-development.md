# How can I compare Amazon Redshift and Clickhouse for software development?
// plain

Amazon Redshift and Clickhouse are both popular open source databases used for software development.

Amazon Redshift is a cloud-based data warehouse service that is based on the PostgreSQL database. It is used for analytics and business intelligence. Amazon Redshift is easy to set up and offers a wide range of features such as columnar storage, data compression, and parallel processing.

Clickhouse is an open source column-oriented database management system. It is designed for analytics and OLAP workloads and can handle large datasets. Clickhouse is highly efficient and offers a wide range of features such as data compression, distributed query processing, and automatic data partitioning.

To compare Amazon Redshift and Clickhouse, we can use the following example code:

```
SELECT *
FROM
  (SELECT 'Amazon Redshift' AS db,
          max_connections,
          data_compression,
          query_processing
   FROM redshift_table) AS a
JOIN
  (SELECT 'Clickhouse' AS db,
          max_connections,
          data_compression,
          query_processing
   FROM clickhouse_table) AS b
ON a.db = b.db;
```

This code will output a table containing the maximum number of connections, data compression, and query processing capabilities of both Amazon Redshift and Clickhouse.

## Code explanation

- SELECT *: This statement is used to select all columns from the two tables.
- FROM (SELECT 'Amazon Redshift' AS db, max_connections, data_compression, query_processing FROM redshift_table) AS a: This statement is used to select the columns from the Amazon Redshift table.
- JOIN (SELECT 'Clickhouse' AS db, max_connections, data_compression, query_processing FROM clickhouse_table) AS b: This statement is used to select the columns from the Clickhouse table.
- ON a.db = b.db: This statement is used to join the two tables on the 'db' column.
