// plain

Amazon Redshift and BigQuery are two popular cloud-based data warehouse solutions. They both offer a range of features designed to make software development easier.

To compare the two, let's look at some of the differences between them.

**Amazon Redshift**

- Uses a columnar data storage model, which is optimized for speed and scalability
- Supports a wide range of SQL and data manipulation operations
- Can be used with various programming languages, including Java, Python, and R
- Offers a wide range of data types, including JSON, XML, and Parquet

**BigQuery**

- Uses a distributed storage model, which is optimized for scalability and cost efficiency
- Supports a wide range of SQL and data manipulation operations
- Can be used with various programming languages, including Java, Python, and Node.js
- Offers a wide range of data types, including CSV, JSON, and Avro

Example code block for querying data from BigQuery:

```
SELECT *
FROM [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
WHERE word = 'happiness'
```

## Output example


```
Row	word	word_count	corpus	corpus_date
1	happiness	1	sonnets	1590
2	happiness	2	phrases	1590
```

The code above queries the public BigQuery dataset for the word 'happiness' and returns the word, the word count, the corpus, and the corpus date.

Overall, both Amazon Redshift and BigQuery offer powerful features for software development. Which one you choose will depend on your specific needs and requirements.
