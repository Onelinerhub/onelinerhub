# How do I use Amazon RDS to host a YouTube video?
// plain

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) can be used to host a YouTube video. To do this, you will need to first create a MySQL database instance on Amazon RDS. After that, you can use the following code to upload your video to the database:

```
INSERT INTO videos (name, video)
VALUES ('My Video', LOAD_FILE('/path/to/video.mp4'));
```

This code will insert the video into the database. The video will be stored as a binary large object (BLOB). You can then use the following code to retrieve the video from the database:

```
SELECT video FROM videos
WHERE name = 'My Video';
```

This code will return the video as a BLOB. Finally, you can use the BLOB to generate an HTML5 video element that can be used to play the video.

**List of code parts with detailed explanation**
1. `INSERT INTO videos (name, video)` - This code inserts a row into the `videos` table, with two columns: `name` and `video`.
2. `VALUES ('My Video', LOAD_FILE('/path/to/video.mp4'));` - This code specifies the values to be inserted into the `videos` table. The first value is the name of the video, and the second value is the video itself, which is loaded from the file `/path/to/video.mp4`.
3. `SELECT video FROM videos` - This code retrieves the `video` column from the `videos` table.
4. `WHERE name = 'My Video';` - This code specifies that only the row with the `name` value of `My Video` should be retrieved.
