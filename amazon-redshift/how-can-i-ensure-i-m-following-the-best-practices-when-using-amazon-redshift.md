// plain

1. Ensure you are using the most recent version of Amazon Redshift by regularly checking the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/welcome.html).

2. Use the appropriate data types and sizes for the data you are storing. For example, if you are storing integers, use the `SMALLINT` type instead of `VARCHAR`.

3. Use the `VACUUM` command to reclaim disk space and improve query performance.

4. Use the `ANALYZE` command to update statistics about the data stored in tables and improve query performance.

5. Use `COMMIT` when you are done with your transactions to ensure your data is written to disk.

6. Use appropriate sort keys and distribution keys to optimize query performance.

7. Use the `COPY` command to load large amounts of data quickly. For example:

```
COPY my_table FROM 's3://my_bucket/my_data.csv'
CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=<my_access_key_id>;aws_secret_access_key=<my_secret_access_key>'
DELIMITER ',';
```
