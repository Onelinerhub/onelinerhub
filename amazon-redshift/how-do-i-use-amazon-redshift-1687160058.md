# How do I use Amazon Redshift?
// plain

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, cloud-based data warehouse service. It is used to store and query large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. To use Amazon Redshift, you must first create a cluster. This can be done through the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

Once the cluster is created, you can then connect to it using a SQL client such as SQL Workbench. You can then create a database and tables, and load data into the database. Once the data is loaded, you can query the data using SQL.

For example, the following code creates a table called 'customers' in the database 'sales':

```
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id integer,
  name varchar(50),
  address varchar(100)
);
```

The code creates a table with three columns: customer_id, name, and address.

Once the table is created, you can then load data into it. To do this, you can use the COPY command. For example, the following code loads data from a CSV file into the 'customers' table:

```
COPY customers FROM 's3://my-bucket/customers.csv'
CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=<your_access_key_id>;aws_secret_access_key=<your_secret_access_key>'
DELIMITER ',';
```

Once the data is loaded, you can then query the data using SQL. For example, the following query returns all customers in the 'customers' table:

```
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

## Output example


```
customer_id | name        | address
------------|-------------|--------------------
1           | John Smith  | 123 Main Street
2           | Jane Doe    | 456 Pine Street
```
