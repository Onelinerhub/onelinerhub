# How do I use Amazon Web Services XLD to deploy applications?
// plain

Amazon Web Services (AWS) XLD is a DevOps automation platform that provides tools for managing application deployments. It is based on Apache Maven and provides a set of plugins that can be used to automate the deployment of applications.

To use AWS XLD to deploy applications, the following steps should be followed:

1. Create a project in XLD using the Maven archetype `archetype-webapp`
2. Configure the project with the application's deployment details
3. Create a deployment plan with the deployment steps and target environment
4. Execute the deployment plan

Example code for creating a deployment plan:
```
// Create a deployment plan
def plan = xld.newDeploymentPlan('my-app-deployment-plan')

// Set the target environment
plan.setTargetEnvironment('Production')

// Set the deployment steps
plan.addStep('deploy')
    .setPlugin('deploy-artifact')
    .setProperty('artifactId', 'my-app')
    .setProperty('version', '1.0.0')
    .setProperty('groupId', 'com.example')
    .setProperty('target', '/opt/my-app')

// Execute the deployment plan
xld.executePlan(plan)
```

Output (if any):
```
[INFO] Deployment plan 'my-app-deployment-plan' executed successfully
```
