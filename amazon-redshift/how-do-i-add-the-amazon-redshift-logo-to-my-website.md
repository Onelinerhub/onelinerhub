// plain

Adding the Amazon Redshift logo to your website is a simple process.

1. First, download the logo from the [Amazon Redshift site](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/).

2. Then, add the logo to your website's directory, usually in the `/images` folder.

3. After that, add the following code to your HTML file, wherever you want the logo to appear:

```
<img src="/images/amazon-redshift-logo.png" alt="Amazon Redshift Logo" />
```

This will add the logo to your website.

4. Finally, you can style the logo with CSS, such as adding a border, changing the size, etc. For example, you can add the following to your CSS file:

```
img.amazon-redshift-logo {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  width: 300px;
}
```

This will add a 1px solid grey border around the logo and set the width to 300px.

You can now view your website and see the Amazon Redshift logo.
