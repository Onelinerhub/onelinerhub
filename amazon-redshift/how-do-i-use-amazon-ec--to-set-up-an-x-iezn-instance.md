# How do I use Amazon EC2 to set up an X2IEZN instance?
// plain

1. First, sign up for an AWS account and create an EC2 instance.
2. Select the instance type you want to use. For example, if you want to use an X2IEZN instance, choose the "General Purpose" instance type.
3. Select the operating system you want to use. For example, if you want to use Ubuntu, select the Ubuntu AMI from the list of available AMIs.
4. Configure the instance settings as desired. For example, if you want to use an X2IEZN instance, select the "X2IEZN" instance type.
5. Once your instance is launched, connect to it via SSH.
6. Install the necessary packages and software. For example, if you want to use an X2IEZN instance, install the X2IEZN package.
7. Start the instance and you are now ready to use your X2IEZN instance.

```
$ ssh -i <path-to-key-file> <username>@<public-ip-of-instance>
$ sudo apt-get install x2iezn
$ x2iezn
```
## Output example

```
X2IEZN is now running.
```

## Code explanation


* `ssh -i <path-to-key-file> <username>@<public-ip-of-instance>` - This command is used to connect to the instance via SSH. The `<path-to-key-file>` is the path to the SSH key file, `<username>` is the username for the instance, and `<public-ip-of-instance>` is the public IP address of the instance.

* `sudo apt-get install x2iezn` - This command is used to install the X2IEZN package.

* `x2iezn` - This command is used to start the X2IEZN instance.
