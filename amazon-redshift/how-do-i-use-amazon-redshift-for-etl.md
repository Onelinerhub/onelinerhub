# How do I use Amazon Redshift for ETL?
// plain

Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service. It can be used for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) tasks.

To use Amazon Redshift for ETL, you will need to use either SQL or a programming language such as Python or Java.

For example, you can use SQL to extract data from an external source, transform it, and load it into Amazon Redshift. The following is an example of an SQL query that would do this:

```
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT *
FROM external_table
WHERE date = '2020-06-01';
```

This query will create a new table called `new_table` in Amazon Redshift and populate it with data from the external table `external_table` where the date is equal to `2020-06-01`.

You can also use Python or Java to write custom ETL scripts that perform more complex tasks such as data cleansing, data transformation, and loading into multiple tables.
