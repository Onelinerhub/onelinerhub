# How do I connect to an Amazon RDS SQL Server instance?
// plain

To connect to an Amazon RDS SQL Server instance, you will need to have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Once you have an account, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an Amazon RDS instance. You can do this through the AWS Management Console or with the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

2. Once your instance is created, you will need to configure the security group for the instance. This will allow you to connect to the instance from your IP address.

3. You will need to create an IAM user and grant it access to the RDS instance. This will allow you to connect to the instance using the IAM user credentials.

4. Once you have the IAM user credentials, you can use them to connect to the instance using the [SQL Server Command Line Utility (SQLCMD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility).

5. The following example code connects to an Amazon RDS SQL Server instance using the IAM user credentials:

```
sqlcmd -S <endpoint> -U <username> -P <password>
```

6. Once you have connected to the instance, you can run SQL queries to retrieve data or modify the database.

7. For more information, please refer to the [Amazon RDS Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/).
