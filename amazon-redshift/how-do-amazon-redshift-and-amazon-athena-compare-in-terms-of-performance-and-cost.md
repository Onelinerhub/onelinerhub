# How do Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena compare in terms of performance and cost?
// plain

Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena are two popular data warehousing solutions from Amazon Web Services. Both are cloud-based services and offer excellent performance and scalability.

In terms of performance, Amazon Redshift is the better choice as it is a columnar data warehouse that is optimized for analytics. It is designed to handle large datasets and provide fast query processing. On the other hand, Amazon Athena is a serverless interactive query service that is good for ad-hoc queries. It is not designed to handle large datasets and is not as fast as Amazon Redshift.

In terms of cost, Amazon Athena is the more cost-effective option. It is a pay-per-query service and you only pay for the queries you run. Amazon Redshift is a more expensive option as it is a pay-per-hour service and you pay for the server hours you use.

## Example code


```
SELECT * FROM my_table
WHERE date_column > '2020-01-01'
```

## Output example


```
id | date_column | data
1  | 2020-02-01 | abc
2  | 2020-03-01 | def
3  | 2020-04-01 | ghi
```

The code above is an example of a query run on Amazon Athena. It is a simple query that returns all records from the table `my_table` where the date column is greater than the specified date.
