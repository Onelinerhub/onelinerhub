# How do I use Amazon EC2 Zowie for software development?
// plain

Amazon EC2 Zowie can be used for software development by launching an EC2 instance. EC2 instances are virtual machines that can be used to run applications and services. To launch an EC2 instance, you need to create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) needed to launch an EC2 instance.

Once the AMI is created, you can then launch an EC2 instance using the AMI. You can then use the EC2 instance to develop software. For example, you can use the EC2 instance to install development tools such as an IDE, a version control system, and libraries. You can also use the EC2 instance to build, test, and deploy your software.

Example code to launch an EC2 instance:

```
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro
```

## Output example


```
{
    "Instances": [
        {
            "InstanceId": "i-xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "ImageId": "ami-xxxxxxxx",
            "InstanceType": "t2.micro"
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```

1. `aws ec2 run-instances`: command to launch an EC2 instance
2. `--image-id ami-xxxxxxxx`: option to specify the AMI to use when launching the instance
3. `--count 1`: option to specify the number of instances to launch
4. `--instance-type t2.micro`: option to specify the type of instance to launch
