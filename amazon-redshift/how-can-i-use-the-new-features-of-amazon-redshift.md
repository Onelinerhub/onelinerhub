Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service offered by Amazon Web Services. It provides a number of new features that can be used to improve the performance and scalability of data warehouses.

One of the most useful new features of Amazon Redshift is its ability to automatically scale up or down based on workloads. This allows users to easily adjust the size of their data warehouses to meet their needs. To use this feature, users can set up an Auto Scaling policy in the Amazon Redshift console.

Another useful feature of Amazon Redshift is its ability to store data in columnar format. Columnar storage allows for faster query performance, as data is stored in columns instead of rows. To use this feature, users can create a table with the “COLUMNAR” storage option.

```
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    id INTEGER,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age INTEGER
)
WITH (
    storage_type = COLUMNAR
);
```

Amazon Redshift also provides a number of performance-enhancing features, such as query optimization, materialized views, and data compression. Query optimization allows users to improve query performance by optimizing the query plan. Materialized views allow users to store pre-computed results for faster query performance. Data compression allows users to reduce the size of their data warehouses, which can improve query performance.

Finally, Amazon Redshift provides a number of security features, such as encryption, authentication, and access control. These features can be used to protect data in a data warehouse from unauthorized access.
