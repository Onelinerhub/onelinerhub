# How can I configure Amazon Redshift to use multiple regions?
// plain

Amazon Redshift can be configured to use multiple regions by setting up a replication cluster in each region. To do this, first launch a Redshift cluster in the primary region, then create a snapshot of the cluster and use it to launch a cluster in the secondary region.

Once the replication cluster is set up, you can configure data replication between the clusters. To do this, you can use the `ALTER TABLE` command with the `SET REPLICATION` option.

For example, the following code will configure a table named `mytable` to replicate to the secondary region:
```
ALTER TABLE mytable SET REPLICATION REGION 'secondary_region_name';
```

You can also use the `REPLICATE` clause to specify which columns should be replicated. For example, the following code will replicate only the `name` and `address` columns of `mytable` to the secondary region:

```
ALTER TABLE mytable REPLICATE (name, address) TO REGION 'secondary_region_name';
```

Once the replication is configured, the data will be replicated from the primary region to the secondary region.
