# How can I compare Amazon Redshift and Amazon Aurora to determine which is best for my software development project?
// plain

To determine which Amazon service is best for a software development project, it is important to understand the differences between Amazon Redshift and Amazon Aurora.

Amazon Redshift is a cloud-based, petabyte-scale data warehouse service. It is designed for large-scale data analysis, and is optimized for complex queries and large datasets. Amazon Aurora is a relational database engine that is optimized for speed and reliability. It is designed for high-performance applications and can be used for both OLTP and OLAP workloads.

To compare the two services, the following example code can be used:

```
SELECT *
FROM
    (SELECT 'Redshift' AS Service,
        query_time AS Query_Time
    FROM redshift_table) a
JOIN
    (SELECT 'Aurora' AS Service,
        query_time AS Query_Time
    FROM aurora_table) b
ON a.Service = b.Service
```

This code will compare the query time of the two services, allowing you to determine which one is better for your project.

## Code explanation

1. `SELECT *` - this statement selects all columns from the tables.
2. `FROM` - this statement specifies the tables that the query will be run on.
3. `SELECT 'Redshift' AS Service, query_time AS Query_Time` - this statement selects the query time from the Redshift table and assigns the value “Redshift” to the “Service” column.
4. `SELECT 'Aurora' AS Service, query_time AS Query_Time` - this statement selects the query time from the Aurora table and assigns the value “Aurora” to the “Service” column.
5. `ON a.Service = b.Service` - this statement joins the two tables on the “Service” column.

By running this query, you can compare the query times of the two services and determine which one is best for your project.
