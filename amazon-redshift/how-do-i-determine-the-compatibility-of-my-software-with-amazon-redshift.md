# How do I determine the compatibility of my software with Amazon Redshift?
// plain

The compatibility of software with Amazon Redshift can be determined by using the [Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html). This driver allows Java applications to connect to an Amazon Redshift cluster.

For example, the following code block can be used to connect to an Amazon Redshift cluster and execute a query:

```java
// Load the driver
Class.forName("com.amazon.redshift.jdbc.Driver");

// Connect to the cluster
String url = "jdbc:redshift://<cluster-endpoint>:<port>/<dbname>";
String user = "<username>";
String password = "<password>";
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

// Execute a query
String query = "SELECT * FROM table";
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
```

The output of this code would be the result set of the query.

## Code explanation


1. The `Class.forName` statement, which loads the driver.
2. The `DriverManager.getConnection` statement, which establishes a connection to the cluster.
3. The `Statement.executeQuery` statement, which executes a query.

By ensuring that these code parts are compatible with the Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver, the compatibility of software with Amazon Redshift can be determined.
