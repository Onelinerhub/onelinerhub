# How do I use Amazon Redshift to store and analyze data?
// plain

1. Amazon Redshift is a fast, scalable data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using standard SQL and your existing business intelligence (BI) tools.
2. To get started, you need to create a cluster and then load your data into it. You can do this either by using the Amazon Redshift console or by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).
3. Once your data is loaded, you can use standard SQL queries to analyze it. For example, to find the total number of orders in your database, you could use the following query:

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM orders;
```

## Output example

```
COUNT(*)
----------
   1234
```

4. You can also use more complex queries to analyze your data. For example, to get the total number of orders by month, you could use the following query:

```
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) as month, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY month;
```

## Output example

```
month  COUNT(*)
-------------
1      123
2      234
3      345
4      456
```

5. In addition to standard SQL queries, you can also use Amazon Redshift's built-in analytics functions to analyze your data. For example, you can use the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function to calculate the 95th percentile of order amounts:

```
SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY order_amount)
FROM orders;
```

## Output example

```
PERCENTILE_CONT
----------------
     123.45
```

6. Amazon Redshift also provides advanced features such as data encryption, data compression, and query optimization.
