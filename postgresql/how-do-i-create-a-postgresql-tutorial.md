# How do I create a PostgreSQL tutorial?
// plain

1. Start by creating a PostgreSQL database. You can do this by running the command `CREATE DATABASE tutorial;` in your terminal.

2. Create a table to store your data. For example, you can create a table called `users` with the following command:

```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

3. Insert some data into the table. You can do this by running the following command:

```
INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com'),
       ('Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com');
```

4. Query the data. You can do this by running the following command:

```
SELECT * FROM users;
```

## Output example

```
 id |  name  |      email
----+--------+---------------------
  1 | John   | john@example.com
  2 | Jane   | jane@example.com
(2 rows)
```

5. Create indexes to improve query performance. For example, you can create an index on the `name` column with the following command:

```
CREATE INDEX users_name_idx ON users (name);
```

6. Create views to simplify complex queries. For example, you can create a view called `user_emails` with the following command:

```
CREATE VIEW user_emails AS
SELECT name, email
FROM users;
```

7. Finally, write up your tutorial with explanations of the commands and their outputs. You can also include relevant links to the official PostgreSQL documentation.
