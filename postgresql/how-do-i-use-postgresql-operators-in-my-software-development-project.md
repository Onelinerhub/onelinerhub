# How do I use PostgreSQL operators in my software development project?
// plain

PostgreSQL operators are used to perform operations on data stored in a PostgreSQL database. They are used to filter, modify, join, and aggregate data in a query.

For example, the following code block uses the PostgreSQL `AND` operator to retrieve data from a table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column1 = 'value1'
AND column2 = 'value2';
```
The output of this query would be all the rows from the table where both `column1` and `column2` have the values `value1` and `value2` respectively.

Other PostgreSQL operators include:
* `OR`: Used to combine two or more conditions.
* `LIKE`: Used to match a string pattern.
* `IN`: Used to check if a value is present in a list.
* `BETWEEN`: Used to check if a value is between two other values.
* `IS NULL`: Used to check if a value is `NULL`.
