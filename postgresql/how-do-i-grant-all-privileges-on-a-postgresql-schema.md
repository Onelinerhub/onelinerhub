# How do I grant all privileges on a PostgreSQL schema?
// plain

To grant all privileges on a PostgreSQL schema, you can use the `GRANT` command. Here is an example of granting all privileges on a schema called "my_schema":

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA my_schema TO my_user;
```

The code above grants all privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, REFERENCES, TRIGGER, CREATE, CONNECT, TEMPORARY, EXECUTE, USAGE) on all tables in the specified schema (`my_schema`) to the specified user (`my_user`).

## Code explanation


- `GRANT`: This is the keyword for granting privileges.
- `ALL PRIVILEGES`: This specifies that all privileges should be granted.
- `ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA`: This specifies that the privileges should be granted on all tables in the specified schema.
- `my_schema`: This is the name of the schema on which the privileges should be granted.
- `TO`: This is the keyword for specifying the user to which the privileges should be granted.
- `my_user`: This is the name of the user to which the privileges should be granted.
