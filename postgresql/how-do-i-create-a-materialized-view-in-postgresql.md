# How do I create a materialized view in PostgreSQL?
// plain

Creating a materialized view in PostgreSQL is fairly straightforward. The basic syntax for creating a materialized view is as follows:
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns
FROM tables
WHERE conditions;
```

The above code will create a materialized view with the name `view_name` that contains the columns specified in the `SELECT` statement. The `FROM` clause specifies the tables to query and the `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions to filter the data.

For example, the following code creates a materialized view called `sales_summary` that contains a summary of sales data:
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE date > '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY product_id;
```

The code creates the materialized view `sales_summary` that contains the `product_id` and the total sales for each product since the beginning of 2020.

The following parts are used in the code:
- `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`: This is used to create a materialized view.
- `view_name`: This is the name of the materialized view.
- `SELECT columns`: This is used to specify the columns to include in the materialized view.
- `FROM tables`: This is used to specify the tables to query.
- `WHERE conditions`: This is used to specify the conditions to filter the data.
- `GROUP BY`: This is used to group the data.
