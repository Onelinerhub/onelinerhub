# How can I use Postgresql's Write Ahead Logging (WAL) feature?
// plain

Postgresql's Write Ahead Logging (WAL) feature is a data protection mechanism that ensures the durability and consistency of the database. It helps to ensure that data is not lost in case of a system crash or power failure.

WAL works by logging all changes made to the database in a separate log file. This file is then used to replay all changes in the event of a system crash or power failure.

## Example code

```
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20)
);

BEGIN;
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (1, 'John');
COMMIT;
```

In this example, Postgresql will first log the `CREATE TABLE` statement to the WAL file before executing it. Then, it will log the `INSERT` statement to the WAL file before executing it. Finally, it will log the `COMMIT` statement to the WAL file before committing the transaction.

If the system crashes or power fails after the `INSERT` statement is logged, but before it is committed, the `INSERT` statement will be replayed from the WAL file when the system is restarted. This ensures that the data is not lost.

## Code explanation


- `CREATE TABLE`: Creates a new table in the database.
- `BEGIN`: Starts a new transaction.
- `INSERT`: Inserts a new row into the table.
- `COMMIT`: Commits the transaction.
