# How can I use PostgreSQL with YAML?
// plain

PostgreSQL can be used with YAML by using a PostgreSQL adapter library such as [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel). This library allows us to create a connection to the PostgreSQL database, and then use the YAML file to interact with the database.

For example, the following code snippet will create a connection to the PostgreSQL database and then use the YAML file to query the database.

```
require 'sequel'
require 'yaml'

# Connect to the PostgreSQL database
DB = Sequel.connect("postgres://user:pass@host/database")

# Load the YAML file
yaml = YAML.load_file('example.yml')

# Query the database using the YAML file
DB[yaml['query']].each do |row|
    puts row
end
```

The output of this code snippet would be the results of the query specified in the YAML file.

## Code explanation


1. `require 'sequel'`: This line includes the Sequel library, which allows us to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
2. `require 'yaml'`: This line includes the YAML library, which allows us to parse the YAML file.
3. `DB = Sequel.connect("postgres://user:pass@host/database")`: This line creates a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
4. `yaml = YAML.load_file('example.yml')`: This line loads the YAML file into a Ruby object.
5. `DB[yaml['query']].each do |row|`: This line queries the database using the query specified in the YAML file.
6. `puts row`: This line prints out the results of the query.
