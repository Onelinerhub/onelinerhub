How can I use PostgreSQL to handle exceptions?
// plain

PostgreSQL provides a variety of ways to handle exceptions.

One of the most common ways to handle exceptions in PostgreSQL is to use the `BEGIN`/`EXCEPTION`/`END` block. This block allows the user to define a set of instructions that will be executed, and if an exception is encountered, a specific error message can be provided.

For example:
```
BEGIN
  -- some instructions
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'An error occurred';
END;
```

In this example, if an exception is encountered, the user-defined error message `An error occurred` will be raised.

Another way to handle exceptions is to use the `RAISE` statement. This statement allows the user to raise an exception, and provide their own error message.

For example:
```
RAISE EXCEPTION 'An error occurred';
```

In this example, the user-defined error message `An error occurred` will be raised.

Finally, PostgreSQL provides a variety of built-in error codes that can be used to handle exceptions. These codes can be used to raise a specific error message, and can be used to provide more detailed information about the exception.

For example:
```
RAISE EXCEPTION 'An error occurred: %', SQLERRM;
```

In this example, the user-defined error message `An error occurred: %` will be raised, and the specific PostgreSQL error code will be included in the message.
