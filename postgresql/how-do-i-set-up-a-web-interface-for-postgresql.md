# How do I set up a web interface for PostgreSQL?
// plain

To set up a web interface for PostgreSQL, you need to install a web server such as Apache or Nginx. You also need to install the PostgreSQL server and create the database.

Once the web server and PostgreSQL server are installed, you can create a web page that connects to the database. You can use a scripting language such as PHP to create a web page that connects to the database.

Example code block:
```
<?php
  // Connecting to the PostgreSQL server
  $dbconn = pg_connect("host=localhost dbname=mydb user=postgres password=mypassword");
  // Querying the database
  $result = pg_query($dbconn, "SELECT * FROM mytable");
  // Printing the results
  while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
    echo "Name: $row[0]  E-mail: $row[1]";
  }
?>
```

The code block above connects to the PostgreSQL server, queries the database, and prints the results.

You can also use a web framework such as Django or Ruby on Rails to create a web page that connects to the database.
