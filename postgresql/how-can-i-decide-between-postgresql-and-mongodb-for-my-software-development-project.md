# How can I decide between PostgreSQL and MongoDB for my software development project?
// plain

When deciding between PostgreSQL and MongoDB for a software development project, there are several factors to consider.

1. **Data Model**: PostgreSQL is a relational database, meaning it stores data in tables with rows and columns. MongoDB is a non-relational database, meaning it stores data in collections of documents.

2. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL is better suited for static data, while MongoDB is better suited for data that is frequently changing or growing.

3. **Performance**: PostgreSQL is generally faster than MongoDB, but MongoDB can scale better than PostgreSQL.

4. **Query Language**: PostgreSQL uses SQL for querying data, while MongoDB uses a query language called MongoDB Query Language (MQL).

5. **Security**: PostgreSQL is more secure than MongoDB, as PostgreSQL has more features for authentication and authorization.

6. **Cost**: PostgreSQL is generally more expensive than MongoDB, as PostgreSQL requires more hardware and software resources.

7. **Example Code**:

```
//PostgreSQL
SELECT * FROM users;

//MongoDB
db.users.find();
```

No output is generated from the example code.
