1. To use PostgreSQL, you need to install it on your machine. You can download the appropriate version of PostgreSQL for your operating system from [PostgreSQL's website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

2. Once PostgreSQL is installed, you can connect to the database server and create databases. To do this, you need to use the `psql` command line tool. For example, the following command will connect to the default PostgreSQL server:

```
psql -h localhost -U postgres
```

3. Once you are connected to the server, you can create a database with the `CREATE DATABASE` command. For example, the following command will create a database named `mydb`:

```
CREATE DATABASE mydb;
```

4. After the database is created, you can connect to it using the `\c` command in `psql`. For example, the following command will connect to the `mydb` database:

```
\c mydb
```

5. Once you are connected to the database, you can create tables, insert data, and perform other database operations. For example, the following command will create a table named `users`:

```
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

6. After creating the table, you can insert data into it with the `INSERT` command. For example, the following command will insert a row into the `users` table:

```
INSERT INTO users (name)
VALUES ('John Doe');
```

7. Finally, you can query data from the database with the `SELECT` command. For example, the following command will select all rows from the `users` table:

```
SELECT * FROM users;
```

The output of this command would be:

```
 id |  name
----+--------
  1 | John Doe
(1 row)
```
