# How can Zalando use PostgreSQL to improve its software development?
// plain

1. Zalando can use PostgreSQL to improve its software development by allowing developers to use the powerful SQL language to query data stored in the database. This enables developers to quickly develop complex queries and create reports, which can be used to optimize software development.

2. Additionally, PostgreSQL provides support for stored procedures, which can be used to create custom functions and procedures that can be used to improve the performance of the software.

3. PostgreSQL also provides support for data types, such as JSON, which can be used to store complex data structures and enable developers to quickly query and manipulate the data.

4. PostgreSQL also provides support for scalability, which can be used to improve the performance of the software by allowing it to handle large amounts of data.

5. Finally, PostgreSQL provides support for replication, which can be used to create redundant copies of the data stored in the database, ensuring that the data is always available and up-to-date.

6. An example of how PostgreSQL can be used to improve software development is shown below:

```
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Insert data into the table
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('John Doe');

-- Query the table
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe';

-- Output
id  | name
----|------
1   | John Doe
```
