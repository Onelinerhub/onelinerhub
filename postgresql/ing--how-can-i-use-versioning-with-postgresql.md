How can I use versioning with PostgreSQL?
// plain

Versioning with PostgreSQL can be accomplished in several ways.

First, PostgreSQL has a built-in versioning system that keeps track of changes to the database. This system is called the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). WAL records all changes to the database and allows for easy rollback to a previous state.

Second, PostgreSQL also has support for third-party version control systems such as Git. This allows developers to track changes to the database and easily revert back to a previous version if needed.

Third, PostgreSQL provides the ability to create a “snapshot” of the database at a given point in time. This snapshot can be used to restore the database to a previous state if needed.

Fourth, PostgreSQL also supports the use of triggers to track changes to the database. These triggers can be used to log changes to the database and can be used to revert back to a previous version if needed.

Finally, PostgreSQL also supports the use of stored procedures to track changes to the database. These stored procedures can be used to log changes to the database and can be used to revert back to a previous version if needed.

Example code for creating a snapshot of the database:
```
CREATE SNAPSHOT my_snapshot AS SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

This code will create a snapshot of the table `my_table` and save it as `my_snapshot`.
