# How do I use PostgreSQL regex to search for a specific pattern?
// plain

To use PostgreSQL regex to search for a specific pattern, you can use the `~` operator. For example, if you wanted to search for all strings that start with `foo` you can use the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name ~ '^foo';
```

This will return all strings that start with `foo` from the `column_name` column in the `table_name` table.

The parts of this query are:

* `SELECT * FROM table_name` - This is the standard SELECT query that returns all columns from the specified table.
* `WHERE column_name ~ '^foo'` - This is the regex search condition. The `~` operator is used to indicate a regex search and the `^foo` pattern indicates that the search should return all strings that start with `foo`.
