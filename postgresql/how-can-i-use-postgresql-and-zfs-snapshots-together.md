# How can I use PostgreSQL and ZFS snapshots together?
// plain

PostgreSQL and ZFS are two powerful tools that can be used together to ensure data consistency and integrity. ZFS snapshots can be used to periodically capture the state of a PostgreSQL database and store it for later use. This allows for quick and easy rollbacks in the event of a data corruption or other issue.

For example, to create a ZFS snapshot of a PostgreSQL database, you can use the following command:

```
zfs snapshot -r <poolname>/<databasename>@<snapshotname>
```

This command will create a read-only snapshot of the database. To roll back to a previous snapshot, you can use the following command:

```
zfs rollback <poolname>/<databasename>@<snapshotname>
```

This will restore the database to the state it was in when the snapshot was taken.

Additionally, ZFS snapshots can be used to create backups of the database. To do this, the following command can be used:

```
zfs send <poolname>/<databasename>@<snapshotname> | gzip > <backupname>.gz
```

This will create a compressed backup of the database that can be stored for later use.

Overall, using PostgreSQL and ZFS together can provide a powerful and reliable way to ensure data consistency and integrity.
