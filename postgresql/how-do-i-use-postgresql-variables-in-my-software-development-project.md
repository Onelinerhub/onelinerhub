# How do I use PostgreSQL variables in my software development project?
// plain

PostgreSQL variables are a powerful tool for software development projects. They are used to store values that can be used throughout the application. They can be used to store constants, configuration settings, and other values that need to be accessed frequently.

Here is an example of how to use PostgreSQL variables in a software development project:

```
-- Create a variable to store a configuration setting
DO $$
DECLARE
  config_setting VARCHAR := 'some_value';
BEGIN
   -- Use the variable in a query
   SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE config_setting = config_setting;
END $$;
```

The example code creates a variable `config_setting` and assigns it a value of `some_value`. This variable is then used in a query to select all rows from `some_table` where `config_setting` is equal to `some_value`.

The following list explains the different parts of the code:

* `DO $$` - This is the start of a block of code that will be executed by the database.
* `DECLARE` - This is the start of the declaration of the variable.
* `config_setting VARCHAR := 'some_value';` - This is the declaration of the variable `config_setting` and its value.
* `SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE config_setting = config_setting;` - This is the query that uses the variable `config_setting`.
* `END $$;` - This is the end of the block of code that will be executed by the database.
