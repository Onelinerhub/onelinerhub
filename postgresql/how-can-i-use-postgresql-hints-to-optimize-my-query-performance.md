# How can I use PostgreSQL hints to optimize my query performance?
// plain

PostgreSQL offers several hints to help optimize query performance. These hints can be used to specify the planner’s behavior for a particular query.

For example, the following query uses the `ENABLE_SEQSCAN` hint to force the planner to use a sequential scan:
```
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col_name = 'some_value' ENABLE_SEQSCAN;
```
The output of this query might look something like this:
```
Seq Scan on tbl_name  (cost=0.00..2.00 rows=1 width=4) (actual time=0.009..0.010 rows=1 loops=1)
  Filter: (col_name = 'some_value'::text)
  Rows Removed by Filter: 1
Planning time: 0.042 ms
Execution time: 0.024 ms
```

Other PostgreSQL hints include `ENABLE_INDEXSCAN`, `ENABLE_HASHAGG`, `ENABLE_NESTLOOP`, `ENABLE_SORT`, `ENABLE_MERGEJOIN`, and `ENABLE_HASHJOIN`. A full list of available hints can be found in the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-set-generator.html).

Using hints can help improve query performance, but they should be used with caution since they may override the query planner’s decisions and lead to suboptimal performance.
