# How can I decide between PostgreSQL and MySQL for my software development project?
// plain

When deciding between PostgreSQL and MySQL for a software development project, there are several factors to consider.

1. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL is more scalable than MySQL, as it supports horizontal scaling, allowing for more data to be stored and processed without affecting performance.

2. **Data Types**: PostgreSQL supports a wide range of data types, such as JSON, XML, and arrays. MySQL does not support these data types.

3. **Query Language**: PostgreSQL supports the more powerful SQL query language, whereas MySQL supports only a subset of SQL.

4. **Security**: PostgreSQL is more secure than MySQL, as it supports data encryption, role-based access control, and other security features.

5. **Cost**: PostgreSQL is an open-source project, so it is free to use. MySQL is a commercial product, so it may require a license to use.

## Example code

```
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE column = 'value'
```
## Output example
 The query will return all records from the table where the value of the column is equal to the specified value.
