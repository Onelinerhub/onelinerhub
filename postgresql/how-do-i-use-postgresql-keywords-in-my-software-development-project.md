# How do I use PostgreSQL keywords in my software development project?
// plain

PostgreSQL keywords are used to control the flow of a software development project. They can be used to create, manipulate, and query data in the database.

For example, the following code block can be used to create a table in PostgreSQL:

```
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

This code block will create a table named 'users' with three columns: user_id, username, and password. The user_id column is defined as a SERIAL data type with a PRIMARY KEY constraint, while the username and password columns are defined as VARCHAR data types with a NOT NULL constraint.

The following code block can be used to insert data into the users table:

```
INSERT INTO users (username, password)
VALUES ('testuser', 'password123');
```

This code block will insert a new row into the users table with the username 'testuser' and the password 'password123'.

PostgreSQL also provides keywords for querying and manipulating data. For example, the following code block can be used to update a row in the users table:

```
UPDATE users
SET password = 'password456'
WHERE username = 'testuser';
```

This code block will update the password of the row with username 'testuser' to 'password456'.
