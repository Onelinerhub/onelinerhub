# How do I switch databases in PostgreSQL?
// plain

To switch databases in PostgreSQL, you can use the `\c` command. This command is used to connect to a database.

For example:
```
\c my_database
```

This command will connect to the `my_database` database.

The parts of this command are as follows:

- `\c`: This is the PostgreSQL command to connect to a database.

- `my_database`: This is the name of the database you are connecting to.

Once the command is executed, you will be connected to the `my_database` database.
