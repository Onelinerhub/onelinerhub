# How do I use PostgreSQL and ZFS together?
// plain

PostgreSQL and ZFS can be used together to provide a reliable and performant database solution. ZFS is a file system that provides advanced features such as data integrity, snapshots, and replication. PostgreSQL is an open source relational database management system.

The following example code creates a ZFS filesystem and mounts it as a PostgreSQL data directory:

```
# Create a ZFS filesystem
zfs create tank/pgdata

# Mount the filesystem
mount -t zfs tank/pgdata /var/lib/postgresql/9.4/main

# Set the ownership and permissions
chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgresql/9.4/main
chmod 0700 /var/lib/postgresql/9.4/main
```

The code above creates a ZFS filesystem called `tank/pgdata`, mounts it to the PostgreSQL data directory, sets the ownership to the `postgres` user, and sets the permissions to `0700`.

Using PostgreSQL and ZFS together provides a number of benefits, such as:

* Data integrity and protection from corruption
* Snapshots for easy backups and restores
* Replication for high availability
