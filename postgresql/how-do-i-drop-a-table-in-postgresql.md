# How do I drop a table in PostgreSQL?
// plain

To drop a table in PostgreSQL, you must use the `DROP TABLE` command. This command will remove the table from the database schema and any associated data.

For example, to drop a table named `employees`:

```
DROP TABLE employees;
```

This command will delete the table and its data from the database.

The following are the components of the `DROP TABLE` command:
- `DROP TABLE`: this is the command used to delete a table
- `employees`: this is the name of the table to be deleted

It is important to note that the `DROP TABLE` command is irreversible and will permanently delete the table and its data from the database.

For more information, please refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-droptable.html).
