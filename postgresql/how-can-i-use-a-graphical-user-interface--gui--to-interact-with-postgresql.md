# How can I use a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with PostgreSQL?
// plain

A graphical user interface (GUI) can be used to interact with PostgreSQL by using a graphical client such as pgAdmin. pgAdmin is a free and open source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL. It provides a graphical interface to manage databases, create and modify tables, write and execute queries, and more.

For example, the following code can be used to connect to a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin:

```
# Connect to PostgreSQL

import pgadmin

conn = pgadmin.connect(
    host="localhost",
    port="5432",
    username="postgres",
    password="password"
)

print(conn)

# Output:
<connection object at 0x7f9c9a5e3f90>
```

The code above:
- Imports the `pgadmin` module
- Establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL server using the `connect()` method
- Prints the connection object

For more information on using pgAdmin, please refer to the [pgAdmin documentation](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/).
