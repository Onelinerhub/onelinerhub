# How can I use Lodash in my online JavaScript project?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used in an online JavaScript project by importing the library into the project.

```javascript
// Import Lodash Library
const _ = require("lodash");
```

Once imported, Lodash functions can be used to manipulate data, perform calculations, and work with collections. For example, the `_.map()` function can be used to iterate over an array and return a new array with the results of the callback function:

```javascript
// Create an array of numbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Use _.map() to iterate over array and double each value
const doubled = _.map(numbers, num => num * 2);

// Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
console.log(doubled);
```

The parts of the code above are:

- `const _ = require("lodash");`: This imports the Lodash library into the project.
- `const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`: This creates an array of numbers.
- `const doubled = _.map(numbers, num => num * 2);`: This uses the `_.map()` function to iterate over the `numbers` array and return a new array with each value doubled.
- `console.log(doubled);`: This logs the result of the `_.map()` function to the console.
