# How can I use Lodash to identify the differences between two JavaScript arrays?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used to identify the differences between two JavaScript arrays.

For example, the following code block uses the `_.difference()` function to compare two arrays and return the elements that are not present in both arrays:
```
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

let difference = _.difference(arr1, arr2);

console.log(difference);
// Output: [1, 2]
```
The `_.difference()` function takes two arrays as arguments and returns the elements that are not present in both arrays. In this example, the output is an array containing the elements `1` and `2`, which are not present in both `arr1` and `arr2`.

Other Lodash functions that can be used to identify the differences between two arrays include `_.xor()`, `_.differenceBy()`, and `_.differenceWith()`.
