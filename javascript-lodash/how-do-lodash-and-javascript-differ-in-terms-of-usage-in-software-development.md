# How do lodash and JavaScript differ in terms of usage in software development?
// plain

Lodash and JavaScript are both programming languages used in software development, but they are quite different.

**Example Code**
```
// Lodash
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const arr2 = _.map(arr1, x => x * 2);
console.log(arr2);

// JavaScript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const arr2 = arr1.map(x => x * 2);
console.log(arr2);
```

**Output**
```
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```

The main difference between lodash and JavaScript is that lodash is a library of utility functions that can be used to simplify common programming tasks, whereas JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language. Lodash provides a wide range of utility functions, such as map, filter, reduce, and find, which can be used to quickly and easily manipulate data. JavaScript, on the other hand, requires more code to achieve the same result, as demonstrated by the example above.

Lodash is also more efficient than JavaScript, as it relies on native functions which are optimized for performance, whereas JavaScript is interpreted at run-time.

In addition, lodash functions are usually easier to read and understand than the equivalent JavaScript code, making them a great choice for developing complex applications.

Overall, lodash and JavaScript are both useful for software development, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. Lodash is great for quickly manipulating data, while JavaScript is better for creating complex applications.

**Parts of the Code Explained**
- `const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];`: This line creates an array of numbers.
- `_.map(arr1, x => x * 2)`: This line uses the lodash map function to multiply each element of the array by 2.
- `arr1.map(x => x * 2)`: This line uses the JavaScript map function to multiply each element of the array by 2.
