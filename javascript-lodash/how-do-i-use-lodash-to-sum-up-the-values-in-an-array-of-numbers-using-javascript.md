# How do I use Lodash to sum up the values in an array of numbers using JavaScript?
// plain

Using Lodash, you can easily sum up the values in an array of numbers using JavaScript. The following example code uses the _.sum() method to sum up the values in an array of numbers:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = _.sum(numbers);
console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

The `_.sum()` method takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of the values in the array. In the example above, the `numbers` array is passed into the `_.sum()` method, which returns the sum of the values in the array, `15`.

## Code explanation


- `const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];` - This line of code declares a `numbers` constant and sets it equal to an array of numbers.
- `const sum = _.sum(numbers);` - This line of code declares a `sum` constant and sets it equal to the result of the `_.sum()` method, which takes the `numbers` array as an argument.
- `console.log(sum);` - This line of code logs the value of the `sum` constant to the console.
