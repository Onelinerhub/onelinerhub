# How do I import the Lodash library into a JavaScript project?
// plain

To import the Lodash library into a JavaScript project, you can use either an ES6 import statement or a CommonJS require statement.

For example, you can use an ES6 import statement to import the entire Lodash library:

```
import _ from 'lodash';
```

Or you can use a CommonJS require statement to import a specific Lodash module:

```
const uniq = require('lodash/uniq');
```

## Code explanation

- `import _ from 'lodash'`: This is an ES6 import statement to import the entire Lodash library.
- `const uniq = require('lodash/uniq')`: This is a CommonJS require statement to import a specific Lodash module.
