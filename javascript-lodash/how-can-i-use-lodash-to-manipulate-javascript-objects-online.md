# How can I use Lodash to manipulate JavaScript objects online?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for manipulating objects. It can be used online through a CDN (Content Delivery Network). For example, the following code snippet uses Lodash to clone an object:

```
let obj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};

let clone = _.clone(obj);

console.log(clone);
// Output: {name: 'John', age: 30}
```

The code above uses the `_.clone()` function provided by Lodash to clone the object `obj`. The cloned object is stored in the `clone` variable.

The following list describes each code part in detail:

- `let obj = {name: 'John', age: 30};` - this creates the object to be cloned.
- `let clone = _.clone(obj);` - this uses the Lodash `_.clone()` function to clone the object `obj` and store the cloned object in the `clone` variable.
- `console.log(clone);` - this logs the cloned object to the console.
