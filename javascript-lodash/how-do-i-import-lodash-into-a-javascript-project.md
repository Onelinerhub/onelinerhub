# How do I import Lodash into a JavaScript project?
// plain

To import Lodash into a JavaScript project, you can use the `import` statement.

For example:

```
import _ from 'lodash';
console.log(_.join(['Hello', 'Lodash'], ' '));
```

## Output example

```
Hello Lodash
```

The code above will import the entire Lodash library and assign it to the `_` variable. We can then use the `_.join()` method to join the two strings.

## Code explanation

- `import _ from 'lodash'`: This statement will import the entire Lodash library and assign it to the `_` variable.
- `_.join()`: This is the Lodash method used to join the two strings.
