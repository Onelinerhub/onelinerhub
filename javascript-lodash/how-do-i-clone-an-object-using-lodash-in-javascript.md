# How do I clone an object using Lodash in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides many utility functions for working with objects. To clone an object using Lodash, you can use the `_.cloneDeep()` function. It will create a deep copy of the object, meaning that the new object will contain copies of all of the original object's properties.

## Example


```
const _ = require('lodash');

const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};

const clone = _.cloneDeep(obj);

console.log(clone);
// Output: { name: 'John', age: 30 }
```

The `_.cloneDeep()` function takes a single argument, the object to be cloned. It returns a new object that is a deep copy of the original.

## Code explanation


* `const _ = require('lodash');` - This line imports the Lodash library.
