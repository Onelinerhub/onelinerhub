# How do I use Lodash with JavaScript on Github?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used with JavaScript on Github by including the library in the project.

To include Lodash in a project on Github, first install the library using npm:

```
npm install --save lodash
```

Then, include the library in the project by importing it in the required JavaScript file:

```
import _ from 'lodash';
```

The utility functions of Lodash can then be used in the project. For example, to find the maximum value in an array of numbers:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const maxValue = _.max(numbers);

console.log(maxValue);

// Output: 5
```

The parts of the code are:

- `npm install --save lodash`: This command installs the Lodash library in the project.
- `import _ from 'lodash'`: This statement imports the Lodash library into the JavaScript file.
- `_.max(numbers)`: This function finds the maximum value in the array of numbers.

More information about Lodash and how to use it can be found on the [Lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/).
