# How can I use lodash in a JavaScript sandbox?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used in a JavaScript sandbox by including the lodash library in the HTML file, and then accessing the library in the JavaScript code. For example:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.15/lodash.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // access lodash library
  let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  let result = _.map(array, x => x * 2);
  console.log(result); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
</script>
```

The code above includes the lodash library from a CDN, and then uses the `_.map` function to double each item in an array.

The parts of the code are:

1. `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.15/lodash.min.js"></script>` - includes the lodash library from a CDN
2. `let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` - creates an array of numbers
3. `let result = _.map(array, x => x * 2)` - uses the `_.map` function to double each item in the array
4. `console.log(result)` - logs the result of the `_.map` function to the console
