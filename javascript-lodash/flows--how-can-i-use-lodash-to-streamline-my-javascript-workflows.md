How can I use Lodash to streamline my JavaScript workflows?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for manipulating and working with objects, arrays, and collections. It can be used to streamline and simplify the development of complex JavaScript applications. For example, Lodash provides a `_.map()` function which can be used to iterate over an array and apply a transformation to each element.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = _.map(numbers, num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Lodash also provides functions for manipulating objects, such as `_.get()` which can be used to safely access a deeply nested property from an object.

```
const person = {
  name: {
    first: 'John',
    last: 'Doe'
  }
};
const firstName = _.get(person, 'name.first');
console.log(firstName); // 'John'
```

Lodash also provides functions for working with collections, such as `_.groupBy()` which can be used to group a collection of objects by a given property.

```
const people = [
  { name: 'John', age: 20 },
  { name: 'Jane', age: 21 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 20 }
];
const grouped = _.groupBy(people, 'age');
console.log(grouped);
/*
  {
    20: [{ name: 'John', age: 20 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 20 }],
    21: [{ name: 'Jane', age: 21 }]
  }
*/
```

By using Lodash, developers can quickly and easily access powerful utility functions for manipulating and working with objects, arrays, and collections. This can save a lot of time and effort when developing complex JavaScript applications.
