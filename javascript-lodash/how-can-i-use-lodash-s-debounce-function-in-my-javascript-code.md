# How can I use Lodash's debounce function in my JavaScript code?
// plain

The [Lodash debounce function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce) is a useful utility for delaying the execution of a function in JavaScript. It is used to group multiple sequential calls into a single call and can be especially useful when dealing with events that are fired rapidly, such as window resizing or keypressing.

Here is an example of how to use Lodash's debounce function in JavaScript:

```javascript
const debouncedFunc = _.debounce(() => {
  console.log('This function will be executed after 500ms');
}, 500);

// Call debouncedFunc multiple times
debouncedFunc();
debouncedFunc();
debouncedFunc();

// Output:
// This function will be executed after 500ms
```

In the example above, `_.debounce()` takes two arguments:

1. The function to be debounced (in this case, a function that logs a message to the console).
2. The delay (in this case, 500ms).

The debounced function is then called multiple times, but the function is only executed after the delay has elapsed.
