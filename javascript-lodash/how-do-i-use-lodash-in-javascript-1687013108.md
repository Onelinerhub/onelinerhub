# How do I use Lodash in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used to simplify and optimize code, and is especially useful for working with collections and arrays.

To use Lodash in JavaScript, you need to include the library in your project. This can be done by installing it via a package manager, such as npm, or by directly including the library in your HTML file.

Once Lodash is included, you can use its functions in your code. For example, to use the _.map() function to iterate over an array and double each element:

```
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let doubledArray = _.map(array, (num) => {
  return num * 2;
});

console.log(doubledArray);  // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, the _.map() function takes two arguments: an array and a callback function. The callback function is invoked for each element in the array, and the return value of each invocation is used to replace the corresponding element in the new array.

Lodash also provides a wide range of other utility functions, such as _.reduce() for reducing an array to a single value, _.filter() for filtering an array based on a condition, and _.find() for finding an element in an array that matches a given condition.

For more information about Lodash and its functions, please refer to the official documentation: https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15

You can also find a wide range of tutorials and examples on the web. A good starting point is the Lodash official website: https://lodash.com/
