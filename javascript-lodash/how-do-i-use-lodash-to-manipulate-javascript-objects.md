# How do I use Lodash to manipulate JavaScript objects?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for manipulating objects. It is possible to use Lodash to perform operations such as copying, merging, sorting, and filtering objects.

For example, the following code uses Lodash to copy an object:

```
const _ = require('lodash');

const obj1 = {a: 1, b: 2};
const obj2 = _.cloneDeep(obj1);

console.log(obj2);
// Output: {a: 1, b: 2}
```

In the code above, the `_.cloneDeep()` function is used to create a deep copy of the `obj1` object, and assign it to the `obj2` object.

## Code explanation

- `const _ = require('lodash');`: This line imports the Lodash library.
- `const obj1 = {a: 1, b: 2};`: This line creates an object with two properties.
- `const obj2 = _.cloneDeep(obj1);`: This line uses the `_.cloneDeep()` function to create a deep copy of the `obj1` object, and assign it to the `obj2` object.
- `console.log(obj2);`: This line logs the `obj2` object to the console.
