# How can I use Lodash to perform a deep merge in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. One of the functions it provides is a deep merge, which is used to merge two or more objects together.

The `_.merge()` function can be used to perform a deep merge in JavaScript. It takes two or more objects as arguments and returns a new object with all the properties from the source objects merged together.

## Example


```
const object1 = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 20
};

const object2 = {
  name: 'Jane',
  job: 'programmer'
};

const mergedObject = _.merge(object1, object2);

console.log(mergedObject);

// Output:
// { name: 'Jane', age: 20, job: 'programmer' }
```

The `_.merge()` function will overwrite any duplicate properties with the values from the last object. It will also merge nested objects.

Parts of the code:

- `const object1 = { name: 'John', age: 20 };` - Declares an object with two properties.
- `const object2 = { name: 'Jane', job: 'programmer' };` - Declares a second object with two properties.
- `const mergedObject = _.merge(object1, object2);` - Calls the `_.merge()` function with two objects as arguments and assigns the returned object to a new variable.
- `console.log(mergedObject);` - Logs the merged object to the console.
