# How do I use Lodash in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used in both Node.js and the browser.

To use Lodash in a project, you first need to install it using a package manager such as npm or yarn.

```
npm install lodash
```

Once Lodash is installed, you can import it into your JavaScript file using the `require()` or `import` statements.

```
const _ = require('lodash');
```

Then, you can use any of the Lodash functions. For example, to get the first element of an array, you can use the `_.head()` function.

```
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const firstElement = _.head(array);
console.log(firstElement); // Output: 1
```

You can find more information about using Lodash in the [official documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/).
