# How can I fix my JavaScript Lodash code that isn't working?
// plain

The first step to fixing a Lodash code that isn't working is to identify the source of the issue. This can be done by debugging the code and looking for errors in the console. Once the source of the issue is identified, the code can be modified to fix the issue.

For example, if the issue is related to a Lodash method, such as `_.cloneDeep()`, the code can be modified to use a different method, such as `_.clone()`.

```
let object = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 20
};

let clone = _.cloneDeep(object);
console.log(clone);
```

## Output example

```
{
    name: 'John',
    age: 20
}
```

Alternatively, if the issue is related to data types, the code can be modified to use the correct data type. For example, if the code is expecting an array but is receiving an object, the code can be modified to use the `_.map()` method to convert the object into an array.

```
let object = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 20
};

let array = _.map(object, (value, key) => {
    return [key, value];
});
console.log(array);
```

## Output example

```
[
    ['name', 'John'],
    ['age', 20]
]
```

In addition to the methods and data types, the code can also be checked for syntax errors. Common syntax errors include missing parentheses, brackets, or braces, as well as typos in variable names.

Finally, if the issue persists, the code can be checked against the Lodash documentation to ensure that the code is using the correct methods and parameters.
