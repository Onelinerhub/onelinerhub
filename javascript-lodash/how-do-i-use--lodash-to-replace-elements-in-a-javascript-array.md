# How do I use _lodash to replace elements in a JavaScript array?
// plain

Using _lodash, you can easily replace elements in a JavaScript array. Here's an example:

```
const _ = require('lodash');

let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let replaced = _.replace(array, 3, 7);

console.log(replaced);
// Output: [1, 2, 7, 4, 5]
```

The code above uses the `_.replace()` method from _lodash to replace the element `3` in the array `array` with the element `7`. This results in a new array being returned with the element `3` replaced by `7`.

The code can be broken down into the following parts:

1. The first line imports the _lodash library.
2. The second line creates an array with the elements `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` and `5`.
3. The third line uses the `_.replace()` method to replace the element `3` in the array `array` with the element `7`.
4. The fourth line logs the new array to the console.

For more information on the `_.replace()` method, please refer to the [_lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#replace).
