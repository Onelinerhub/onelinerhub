# How can I use Lodash to create a predicate in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used to create predicates in JavaScript. A predicate is a function that returns a boolean value based on the input.

Example code using Lodash to create a predicate:
```
const _ = require('lodash');
const isEven = _.overEvery([
  _.isNumber,
  _.isInteger,
  _.partialRight(_.modulo, 2, 0)
]);

console.log(isEven(2)); // true
console.log(isEven(3)); // false
```

The code above uses Lodash's `overEvery` method to create a predicate that returns `true` if the input is a number and an even integer. It uses the `isNumber` and `isInteger` methods to check if the input is a number and an integer, respectively. It then uses the `partialRight` method to create a function that returns the remainder when the input is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the input is an even integer.

Parts of the code:
- `const _ = require('lodash');`: This line imports Lodash into the code.
- `const isEven = _.overEvery([`: This line creates a `isEven` constant and assigns it to the result of the `overEvery` method.
- `_.isNumber,`: This is one of the functions passed to the `overEvery` method. It checks if the input is a number.
- `_.isInteger,`: This is one of the functions passed to the `overEvery` method. It checks if the input is an integer.
- `_.partialRight(_.modulo, 2, 0)`: This is one of the functions passed to the `overEvery` method. It creates a function that returns the remainder when the input is divided by 2.
- `console.log(isEven(2)); // true`: This line logs `true` to the console, since 2 is an even integer.
- `console.log(isEven(3)); // false`: This line logs `false` to the console, since 3 is not an even integer.
