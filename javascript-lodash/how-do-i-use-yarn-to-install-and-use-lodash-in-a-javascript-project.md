// plain

### Answer

Using yarn to install and use lodash in a JavaScript project is easy.

First, install lodash into your project using yarn:

```
yarn add lodash
```

Once the installation is complete, you can import lodash into your project:

```javascript
import _ from 'lodash';
```

Then you can use lodash in your project. For example, you can use the `_.assign()` function to merge objects:

```javascript
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };

const obj3 = _.assign(obj1, obj2);

console.log(obj3); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
```

For more information on using lodash, please refer to the [official documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15).
