# How do I use the Lodash module in JavaScript?
// plain

The Lodash module is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks.

To use the Lodash module, you must first install it using npm (Node Package Manager).

```
npm install lodash
```

Once Lodash is installed, you can import it into your JavaScript file using the `require()` function:

```
const _ = require('lodash');
```

You can then use the functions provided by Lodash in your code. For example, the `_.map()` function allows you to iterate over an array and apply a function to each element:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = _.map(numbers, (num) => num * 2);

console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

You can find more information about the Lodash module, including a list of all the functions it provides, in the [Lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/).
