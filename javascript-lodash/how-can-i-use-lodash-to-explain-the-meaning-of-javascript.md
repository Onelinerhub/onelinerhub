# How can I use Lodash to explain the meaning of JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used to explain the meaning of JavaScript by providing an example of how to use it to solve a problem.

For example, let's say we want to find the longest word in an array of strings. We can use Lodash's `_.maxBy` function to accomplish this:

```
const words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
const longestWord = _.maxBy(words, word => word.length)
```

The output of this code would be `"banana"`.

## Code explanation

- `const words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` - declares an array of strings
- `const longestWord = _.maxBy(words, word => word.length)` - uses Lodash's `_.maxBy` function to find the longest word in the array
- `word => word.length` - a callback function that returns the length of a given word

This example shows how Lodash can be used to solve a problem in JavaScript.
