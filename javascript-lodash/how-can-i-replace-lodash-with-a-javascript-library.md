# How can I replace Lodash with a JavaScript library?
// plain

The Lodash library is a great tool for simplifying and manipulating data in JavaScript. However, it is possible to replace Lodash with a JavaScript library. One example of a library that can replace Lodash is Ramda.js. Ramda.js is a functional programming library that provides a variety of functions for manipulating data.

For example, Lodash provides a `_.map()` function for transforming an array of data. The same functionality can be achieved with Ramda.js using the `R.map()` function.

```js
const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const lodashMap = _.map(data, x => x * 2);
// [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

const ramdaMap = R.map(x => x * 2, data);
// [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Ramda.js also provides a variety of other functions for manipulating data, such as `R.filter()`, `R.reduce()`, `R.sortBy()`, and `R.groupBy()`.

In addition to Ramda.js, there are several other JavaScript libraries that can be used to replace Lodash, such as underscore.js, lazy.js, and functional.js.
