# How can I use Lodash in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It is an alternative to the native JavaScript functions and helps to increase the productivity of developers.

To use Lodash in JavaScript, you need to include the lodash library in your HTML page.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.15/lodash.min.js"></script>
```

Then you can use the lodash functions in your code. For example, to find the maximum value in an array:

```
var array = [1,2,3,4,5];
var maxValue = _.max(array);
console.log(maxValue); // Output: 5
```

The code above uses the `_.max()` function from Lodash to find the maximum value in the `array` variable.

Lodash also provides functions for manipulating objects, such as `_.get()` and `_.set()` for getting and setting values in an object.

Here is an example of using `_.get()` to get a value from an object:

```
var object = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};

var name = _.get(object, 'name');
console.log(name); // Output: John
```

The code above uses the `_.get()` function to get the value of the `name` property from the `object` variable.

For more information about Lodash and its functions, please refer to the [official documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/).
