# How can I use Lodash to simplify my JavaScript code?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used to simplify and speed up development by reducing the amount of code you have to write. Here is an example of how Lodash can be used to simplify code:

```
// Without Lodash
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var sum = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
}

console.log(sum); // 15

// With Lodash
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var sum = _.sum(arr);

console.log(sum); // 15
```

The code above uses Lodash's `_.sum()` function to calculate the sum of an array of numbers. This is much simpler than writing a for loop to iterate over the array and add up the values.

Lodash also provides a wide range of other functions for manipulating arrays, objects, strings, and numbers. For more information, see the [Lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/).
