# How can I use Lodash to test my JavaScript code?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used to test JavaScript code by using its `_.isEqual()` method to compare two values and assert that they are equal.

For example:

```
const _ = require('lodash');

const a = 1;
const b = 1;

const result = _.isEqual(a, b);

console.log(result);
// Output: true
```

In this example, we use the `_.isEqual()` method to compare the two values `a` and `b`, which are both equal to `1`. The output of the code is `true`, which indicates that the two values are equal.

## Code explanation


- `const _ = require('lodash');` - This line imports the Lodash library into the code.
- `const a = 1;` - This line declares a variable `a` and assigns it the value `1`.
- `const b = 1;` - This line declares a variable `b` and assigns it the value `1`.
- `const result = _.isEqual(a, b);` - This line uses the `_.isEqual()` method to compare the two values `a` and `b` and assigns the result to the variable `result`.
- `console.log(result);` - This line logs the result of the comparison to the console.
