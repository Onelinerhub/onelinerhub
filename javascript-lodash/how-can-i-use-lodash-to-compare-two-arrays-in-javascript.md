# How can I use Lodash to compare two arrays in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used to compare two arrays in the following way:

1. First, include the Lodash library in your project:
```
const _ = require('lodash');
```

2. Then, use the `_.isEqual()` function to compare two arrays:
```
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(_.isEqual(arr1, arr2));
// Output: true
```

3. The `_.isEqual()` function will return `true` if the two arrays are equal, and `false` if they are not. It performs a deep comparison of the elements in the arrays, meaning that it will compare the values of the elements as well as the order of the elements.

4. Alternatively, you can use the `_.difference()` function to compare two arrays and get the elements that are present in one array but not the other:
```
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [2, 3, 4];

console.log(_.difference(arr1, arr2));
// Output: [1]
```

5. The `_.difference()` function will return an array of the elements that are present in one of the arrays, but not the other.

6. You can also use the `_.xor()` function to compare two arrays and get the elements that are present in one array or the other, but not both:
```
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [2, 3, 4];

console.log(_.xor(arr1, arr2));
// Output: [1, 4]
```

7. The `_.xor()` function will return an array of the elements that are present in one of the arrays, but not both.
