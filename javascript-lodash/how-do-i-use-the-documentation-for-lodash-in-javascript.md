# How do I use the documentation for Lodash in JavaScript?
// plain

Using the Lodash Documentation is a great way to learn how to use the library for JavaScript. It provides detailed examples and explanations of each function.

Here is an example of using the `_.map()` function:
```
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
const result = _.map(numbers, (num) => num * 2);
```
The output of the above code will be: `[2,4,6,8,10]`

The `_.map()` function takes two arguments, the array to map over and a callback function. The callback function is invoked on each element of the array and the result of the callback is used to create the new array. In the example above, each number is multiplied by two and the result is stored in the `result` variable.
