# How can I use Lodash to compare an array of objects in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a great tool for comparing arrays of objects in JavaScript. It provides a wide range of methods to help you compare objects in an array quickly and easily.

For example, the `_.isEqual()` method allows you to compare two objects and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not they are equal.

```
let a = {name: 'John', age: 20};
let b = {name: 'John', age: 20};

console.log(_.isEqual(a, b))
// Output: true
```

The `_.difference()` method can be used to compare two arrays and return the values from the first array that are not present in the second array.

```
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [2, 3, 4];

console.log(_.difference(arr1, arr2))
// Output: [1]
```

The `_.some()` and `_.every()` methods can be used to check if some or every element in an array meets a certain condition.

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

console.log(_.some(arr, el => el > 3))
// Output: true

console.log(_.every(arr, el => el > 3))
// Output: false
```

Finally, the `_.find()` and `_.findIndex()` methods can be used to find the first element in an array that meets a certain condition.

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

console.log(_.find(arr, el => el > 2))
// Output: 3

console.log(_.findIndex(arr, el => el > 2))
// Output: 2
```

These are just a few of the methods Lodash provides for comparing arrays of objects in JavaScript. To learn more about Lodash and its methods, you can check out the [official documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/).
