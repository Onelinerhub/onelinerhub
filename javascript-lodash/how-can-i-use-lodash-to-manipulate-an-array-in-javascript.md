# How can I use Lodash to manipulate an array in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a powerful JavaScript library that helps developers manipulate arrays. It provides a wide range of functions to simplify the manipulation of arrays. Here is an example of how to use Lodash to manipulate an array in JavaScript:

```
// Create an array
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Use Lodash to manipulate the array
let newArray = _.map(myArray, (item) => {
  return item * 2;
});

// Output
console.log(newArray); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

The code above uses Lodash's `_.map` method to iterate over the array and double each item. The `_.map` method takes two parameters: an array and a function. The function is applied to each item in the array and the result is stored in the new array.

The following is a list of Lodash functions that can be used to manipulate arrays:

- `_.map`: Iterates over an array and applies a function to each item.
- `_.filter`: Iterates over an array and returns a new array with items that pass a given test.
- `_.reduce`: Iterates over an array and reduces it to a single value.
- `_.sortBy`: Sorts an array based on a given criteria.
- `_.find`: Returns the first item in an array that passes a given test.
