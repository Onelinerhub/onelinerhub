# How can I use Lodash in JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It provides a wide range of features, such as:

1. Collection methods: Lodash provides a variety of collection methods for manipulating arrays, objects, and strings. For example, you can use the `_.map()` function to iterate over a collection and apply a transformation to each element.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = _.map(numbers, (number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers);
// [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

2. Utility methods: Lodash also provides a variety of utility methods for performing common operations. For example, you can use the `_.isEqual()` function to determine if two values are equal.

```javascript
const a = { name: 'John' };
const b = { name: 'John' };

console.log(_.isEqual(a, b));
// true
```

3. Chaining: Lodash also provides a chainable syntax for combining multiple operations into a single statement. For example, you can use the `_.chain()` function to chain multiple operations together.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledEvenNumbers = _.chain(numbers)
  .filter((number) => number % 2 === 0)
  .map((number) => number * 2)
  .value();

console.log(doubledEvenNumbers);
// [4, 8]
```

These are just a few of the features that Lodash provides. For more information, please refer to the [Lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/).
