# How can I protect my application from vulnerabilities in the Lodash JavaScript library?
// plain

1. **Update Lodash** - Make sure you are using the latest version of Lodash. This will ensure that any known vulnerabilities have been patched.

2. **Use a Vulnerability Scanner** - Use a vulnerability scanner such as Snyk to scan your application for known vulnerabilities in the Lodash library.

3. **Use a Sandbox** - Use a sandbox environment to test your application for any potential vulnerabilities before deploying it to production.

4. **Use an Application Firewall** - Use an application firewall such as ModSecurity to protect your application from malicious requests.

5. **Implement Security Best Practices** - Implement security best practices such as input validation, secure coding practices, and proper authentication and authorization.

6. **Monitor for Vulnerabilities** - Monitor for any new vulnerabilities in the Lodash library and patch them as soon as possible.

7. **Audit Code Regularly** - Audit your code regularly to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are identified and fixed.

// Example of using the latest version of Lodash
const _ = require('lodash@4.17.15');
