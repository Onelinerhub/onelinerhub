# How to resolve a "_ is not defined" error when using Lodash in JavaScript?
// plain

When using Lodash in JavaScript, a `_ is not defined` error often occurs. This is because Lodash must be imported before it can be used. To resolve this error, the following steps should be taken:

1. Import Lodash into the JavaScript file. This can be done with the following code:
```
import _ from 'lodash';
```
2. Ensure that the Lodash library is installed in the project. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:
```
npm install --save lodash
```
3. Once Lodash is successfully imported, the `_ is not defined` error should no longer appear.
