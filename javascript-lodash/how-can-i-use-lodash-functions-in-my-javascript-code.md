# How can I use Lodash functions in my JavaScript code?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It is a great tool for simplifying complex operations and making code more readable. Here is an example of how to use Lodash functions in JavaScript code:

```
// Import Lodash functions
const _ = require('lodash');

// Create an array
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5];

// Use Lodash map function to double each item in the array
const doubled = _.map(arr, item => item * 2);

// Print the doubled array
console.log(doubled);
// Output: [2,4,6,8,10]
```

1. `require('lodash')` - This imports all of the Lodash functions into your code.
2. `_.map(arr, item => item * 2)` - This uses the Lodash `map` function to double each item in the array.
3. `console.log(doubled)` - This prints the doubled array to the console.

For more information and examples of how to use Lodash, please refer to the [Lodash Documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15).
