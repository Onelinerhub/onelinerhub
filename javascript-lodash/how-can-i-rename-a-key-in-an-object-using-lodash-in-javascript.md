# How can I rename a key in an object using Lodash in JavaScript?
// plain

Using Lodash in JavaScript, you can rename a key in an object by using the `_.set` method. This method allows you to set a value on an object given a path. Here is an example:

```
let myObject = { name: 'Bob' };

_.set(myObject, 'firstName', myObject.name);
delete myObject.name;

console.log(myObject);
// Output: { firstName: 'Bob' }
```

The `_.set` method takes three parameters:
1. The object you want to update.
2. The path of the value you want to set.
3. The value you want to set.

In this example, the first parameter is `myObject`, the second parameter is `'firstName'`, and the third parameter is `myObject.name`. The `_.set` method will set `myObject.firstName` to `myObject.name` and then delete `myObject.name`.
