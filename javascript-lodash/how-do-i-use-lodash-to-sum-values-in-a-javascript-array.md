# How do I use Lodash to sum values in a JavaScript array?
// plain

Using Lodash, you can easily sum values in a JavaScript array. Here is an example of how to do it:

```
let array = [1,2,3,4,5];

let sum = _.sum(array);

console.log(sum);
// Output: 15
```

The code above uses the `_.sum()` method from Lodash to sum the values in the `array` array. This method takes the array as an argument and returns the sum of all its values. In this example, the output is `15`.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* `let array = [1,2,3,4,5];` - this line declares an array of numbers.
* `let sum = _.sum(array);` - this line uses the `_.sum()` method from Lodash to sum the values in the `array` array, and assigns the result to the `sum` variable.
* `console.log(sum);` - this line logs the `sum` variable to the console.
