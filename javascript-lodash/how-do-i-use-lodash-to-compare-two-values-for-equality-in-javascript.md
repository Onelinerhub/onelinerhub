# How do I use Lodash to compare two values for equality in JavaScript?
// plain

Using Lodash to compare two values for equality in JavaScript is simple. The `_.isEqual` method can be used to compare two values and returns a boolean value.

## Example code

```
let value1 = 'Hello';
let value2 = 'Hello';

console.log(_.isEqual(value1, value2));
```

## Output example

```
true
```

The code above contains the following parts:
- `value1` and `value2` are two variables containing the values to be compared.
- The `_.isEqual` method is used to compare the two values, which takes two arguments.
- The result of the comparison is logged to the console using `console.log`.

The output of the code is `true`, indicating that the two values are equal.
