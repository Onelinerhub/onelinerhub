# How can I use lodash in my JavaScript code?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It can be used to simplify and speed up development by abstracting away common tasks such as iterating over collections, manipulating objects, and creating composite functions.

To use lodash in your JavaScript code, first install it using npm:

```
npm install lodash
```

Then import it into your code:

```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');
```

You can then use any of the lodash functions in your code. For example, to find the maximum value in an array:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const max = _.max(arr);
console.log(max); // Output: 5
```

You can also create a composite function by using the `_.flow` method, which takes in an array of functions and returns a new function that executes them in sequence:

```javascript
const addOne = x => x + 1;
const multiplyByTwo = x => x * 2;
const addOneAndMultiplyByTwo = _.flow([addOne, multiplyByTwo]);
console.log(addOneAndMultiplyByTwo(2)); // Output: 6
```

There are many more functions available in lodash, so be sure to check out the [official documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/).

Happy coding!
