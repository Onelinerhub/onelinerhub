# How do I compare Lodash filter and JavaScript filter to choose which one to use in my software development project?
// plain

Lodash and JavaScript filter are both used to filter data from a given array.

To choose which one to use in a software development project, it is important to consider the following:

1. Performance: Lodash filter is more performant than the native JavaScript filter, as Lodash filter is written in optimized C++.

2. Syntax: Lodash filter is a lot simpler to use than the native JavaScript filter, as Lodash filter uses a chainable syntax.

## Example


```javascript
// Native JavaScript filter
const filteredData = data.filter(item => item.id === 1);

// Lodash filter
const filteredData = _.filter(data, {id: 1});
```

3. Functionality: Lodash filter has more features than the native JavaScript filter, such as the ability to filter by multiple criteria.

## Example


```javascript
// Native JavaScript filter
const filteredData = data.filter(item => item.id === 1 && item.name === 'John');

// Lodash filter
const filteredData = _.filter(data, {id: 1, name: 'John'});
```

4. Compatibility: Lodash filter is compatible with all versions of JavaScript, whereas the native JavaScript filter is only available in modern browsers.

In conclusion, Lodash filter is generally the better choice for software development projects due to its performance, syntax, functionality, and compatibility.
