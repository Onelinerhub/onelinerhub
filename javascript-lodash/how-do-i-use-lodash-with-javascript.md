# How do I use Lodash with JavaScript?
// plain

Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for manipulating objects, arrays, numbers, and strings. It is used to simplify complex operations and make code more readable.

To use Lodash with JavaScript, you will need to include the library in your project. This can be done by downloading the library from the [Lodash website](https://lodash.com/), or by using a package manager such as `npm`.

Once Lodash is included in your project, you can use it by importing it into your JavaScript code. For example, the following code imports the `map` function from Lodash:

```javascript
import { map } from 'lodash';
```

You can then use the imported function to transform an array of numbers:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const result = map(numbers, num => num * 2);

console.log(result); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

Lodash provides a wide variety of utility functions, including functions for manipulating objects, arrays, numbers, and strings. For more information, see the [Lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/).
