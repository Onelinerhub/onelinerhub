# How do I use tar and gzip to compress a Python file?
// plain

`tar` and `gzip` are two popular tools for compressing files. To compress a Python file, you can use a combination of both tools. Here's an example command:

```
tar -zcvf my_python_file.tar.gz my_python_file.py
```

This command will create a compressed `tar` archive file, `my_python_file.tar.gz`, containing `my_python_file.py`.

The command is composed of the following parts:

* `tar`: the command to create an archive file
* `-zcvf`: the flags used to compress the archive using `gzip`
* `my_python_file.tar.gz`: the name of the compressed archive file
* `my_python_file.py`: the Python file to compress

For more information about `tar` and `gzip`, see the following links:

* [gzip Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/manual/gzip.html)
