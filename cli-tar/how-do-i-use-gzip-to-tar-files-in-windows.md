# How do I use gzip to tar files in Windows?
// plain

Using gzip to tar files in Windows is a simple process. Here's an example of how to do it:

```
$ tar -cvzf myfiles.tar.gz myfiles/
```

This command will create a new file called `myfiles.tar.gz` containing all the files and folders in the `myfiles` directory.

## Code explanation

- `tar` - The command to create an archive
- `-cvzf` - Flags to compress the archive with gzip
- `myfiles.tar.gz` - The name of the new archive file
- `myfiles/` - The directory to be archived
