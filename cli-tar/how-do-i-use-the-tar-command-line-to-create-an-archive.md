# How do I use the tar command line to create an archive?
// plain

The `tar` command line is a powerful tool for creating archives of files and directories. Here is an example of how to use it to create an archive:

```
tar -cvf myarchive.tar /path/to/files/
```

This command will create an archive named `myarchive.tar` with the contents of the `/path/to/files/` directory.

The parts of the command are:
- `tar`: the name of the command
- `-cvf`: the flags that specify the type of archive to create and the name of the archive
- `myarchive.tar`: the name of the archive to be created
- `/path/to/files/`: the path to the directory whose contents should be archived

For more information on the `tar` command, see the [GNU tar manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html).
