// plain

The Unix tar xzvf command is used to extract files from a compressed tar archive.

```
tar xzvf archive.tar.gz
```

This command will extract all files in the archive.tar.gz file and create a directory with the same name as the archive.

## Code explanation


* tar – The tar command is used to create, view, extract, and manipulate archives.
* x – The x option tells tar to extract the files from the archive.
* z – The z option tells tar to decompress the archive using gzip.
* v – The v option tells tar to display verbose output while it extracts the files.
* f – The f option tells tar to use the archive.tar.gz file as the archive to extract.

No output is generated from this command.
