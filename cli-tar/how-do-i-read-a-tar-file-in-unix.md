# How do I read a tar file in Unix?
// plain

In Unix, you can read a tar file by using the `tar` command. The basic syntax for this command is `tar -xvf <filename>`, where `-x` is used to extract the files, `-v` is used to set verbose mode, and `-f` is used to specify the file name.

For example, if you wanted to extract the contents of the file `example.tar`, you would use the command:

```
tar -xvf example.tar
```

This command will extract all the files from the tar file and display the names of the files as they are extracted.
