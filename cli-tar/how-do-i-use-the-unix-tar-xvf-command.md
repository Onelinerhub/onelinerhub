# How do I use the Unix tar xvf command?
// plain

The Unix `tar xvf` command is used to extract files from a tar archive. The `x` flag indicates that the files should be extracted, the `v` flag indicates that the process should be verbose, and the `f` flag indicates that the argument following the command should be treated as a file. The example below would extract the contents of `myarchive.tar` into the current working directory:

```
tar xvf myarchive.tar
```

The output of this command will be a list of all the files and folders that were extracted from the archive.

The parts of the command are as follows:

- tar: The command to extract files from an archive
- x: The flag to indicate that files should be extracted
- v: The flag to indicate that the process should be verbose
- f: The flag to indicate that the argument following the command is a file
- myarchive.tar: The file to be extracted

More information about the `tar` command can be found in the [GNU tar manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/tar_51.html).
