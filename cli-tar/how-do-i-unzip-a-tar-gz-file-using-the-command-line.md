# How do I unzip a tar.gz file using the command line?
// plain

To unzip a `tar.gz` file using the command line, use the `tar` command followed by the `-xzf` option.

The syntax for this command is:
```
tar -xzf filename.tar.gz
```

This command will extract the files in the `filename.tar.gz` archive in the current directory.

The parts of the command are:
- `tar`: The tar command is used to create and manipulate archive files in Linux/Unix.
- `-xzf`: This option tells tar to extract the files.
- `filename.tar.gz`: This is the name of the file that you want to extract.

For more information and examples of using the `tar` command, see the [GNU tar manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_5.html).
