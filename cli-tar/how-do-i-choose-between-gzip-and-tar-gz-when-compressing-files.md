# How do I choose between gzip and tar.gz when compressing files?
// plain

When compressing files, it is important to choose the right format. Gzip and tar.gz are two popular options for compressing files.

Gzip is a single-file compression algorithm that works well for small files. It is simple to use and can be used with the command line tool `gzip`:

```
gzip myfile.txt
```

This will create a new file called `myfile.txt.gz`.

Tar.gz, on the other hand, is a combination of the tar archiving utility and gzip compression. It can be used to compress multiple files into a single archive. To use it, the command line tool `tar` is used:

```
tar -zcvf myfiles.tar.gz myfile1.txt myfile2.txt
```

This will create a single file called `myfiles.tar.gz` containing both `myfile1.txt` and `myfile2.txt`.

In general, gzip is the best choice when compressing a single file, while tar.gz is the best choice when compressing multiple files.
