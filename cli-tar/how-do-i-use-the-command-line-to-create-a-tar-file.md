# How do I use the command line to create a tar file?
// plain

To create a tar file using the command line, you can use the `tar` command. The basic syntax for creating a tar file is as follows:
```
tar -cvf <archive-name>.tar <file-or-directory-to-archive>
```

This command will create an archive file called `<archive-name>.tar` containing the file or directory specified.

## Code explanation

- `tar`: This is the command to create the tar file.
- `-cvf`: This is the flag used to specify the action to be taken. The `-c` flag is to create a new archive, the `-v` flag is to be verbose (list the files being archived), and the `-f` flag is to specify the filename of the archive.
- `<archive-name>.tar`: This is the name of the tar file that will be created.
- `<file-or-directory-to-archive>`: This is the file or directory that will be archived.

Here is an example of creating a tar file called `myarchive.tar` containing the directory `mydir`:
```
tar -cvf myarchive.tar mydir
```
