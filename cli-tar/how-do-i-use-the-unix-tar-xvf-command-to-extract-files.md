# How do I use the Unix tar xvf command to extract files?
// plain

The `tar xvf` command is used to extract files from a tar archive. This command takes the archive file as an argument, and extracts the contents of the archive into the current directory.

## Example

```
tar xvf archive.tar
```

This command will extract all of the files from the archive.tar file into the current directory.

The parts of the command are as follows:
- `tar`: The tar command is used to create and manipulate tar archives.
- `x`: The `x` flag indicates that the tar command should extract the contents of the archive.
- `v`: The `v` flag indicates that the tar command should be verbose, and output the names of the files as they are extracted.
- `f`: The `f` flag indicates that the tar command should read the archive from a file.
