# How do I pack a tar file in Unix?
// plain

To pack a tar file in Unix, you need to use the `tar` command. This command allows you to create tar archives, which are files that contain multiple files and directories.

Here is an example command to pack a tar file:
```
tar -cvf archive.tar file1.txt file2.txt directory1
```

This command will create a tar archive named `archive.tar` that contains the files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` as well as the directory `directory1`.

The parts of the command are:
* `tar`: The command to create tar archives.
* `-cvf`: Flags to indicate that we are creating a tar archive, preserving the original file and directory names, and setting the output file name.
* `archive.tar`: The name of the tar archive to be created.
* `file1.txt file2.txt directory1`: The files and directories to be included in the tar archive.

For more information on the `tar` command, see the [GNU Tar Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/tar_1.html).
