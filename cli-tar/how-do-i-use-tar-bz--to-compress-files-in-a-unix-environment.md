# How do I use tar.bz2 to compress files in a Unix environment?
// plain

To compress files in a Unix environment using `tar.bz2`, the following command should be used:

```
tar -cjvf [archive_name].tar.bz2 [file_name]
```

This command will create a compressed file named `[archive_name].tar.bz2` containing the file `[file_name]`.

1. `tar`: The Unix command for creating, modifying, and extracting files from an archive.
2. `-c`: Create a new archive.
3. `-j`: Use bzip2 compression.
4. `-v`: Verbose mode.
5. `-f`: Specify the name of the archive.
6. `[archive_name]`: The name of the archive to be created.
7. `[file_name]`: The file to be compressed and added to the archive.

If the command is successful, the following output will be displayed:

```
adding: [file_name] (deflated 69%)
```
