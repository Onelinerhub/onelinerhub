# How do I use tar commands with xz?
// plain

The `tar` command can be used with the `xz` command to compress files and directories. The `xz` command is used to compress a file or directory into a `.xz` file. The `tar` command can then be used to create an archive containing the `.xz` file.

The syntax for this command is as follows:

```
tar -cvJf <archive_name>.tar.xz <file_or_directory>
```

The `-c` flag tells the `tar` command to create an archive, the `-v` flag tells the `tar` command to be verbose and display the progress of the archive creation, the `-J` flag tells the `tar` command to use the `xz` command to compress the archive, and the `-f` flag tells the `tar` command to use the specified file name for the archive.

The following example creates an archive named `my_archive.tar.xz` containing the file `my_file.txt`:

```
tar -cvJf my_archive.tar.xz my_file.txt
```

The output of this command should be something like this:

```
my_file.txt
```
