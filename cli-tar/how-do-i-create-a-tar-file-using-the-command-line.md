# How do I create a tar file using the command line?
// plain

Creating a tar file using the command line is a relatively simple process. The basic syntax for creating a tar file is as follows:

```
tar -cf <filename>.tar <list of files>
```

This command will create a tar file called `<filename>.tar` containing all of the files specified in `<list of files>`. For example, to create a tar file containing all the files in the current directory, you can use the following command:

```
tar -cf myfiles.tar *
```

This command will create a tar file called `myfiles.tar` containing all of the files in the current directory.

If you want to create a tar file containing only certain files or directories, you can specify them individually in the `<list of files>` argument. For example, to create a tar file containing all the files in the current directory with the `.txt` extension, you can use the following command:

```
tar -cf myfiles.tar *.txt
```

This command will create a tar file called `myfiles.tar` containing all the files in the current directory with the `.txt` extension.

You can also compress the tar file by using the `-z` flag. For example, to create a compressed tar file containing all the files in the current directory, you can use the following command:

```
tar -cfz myfiles.tar.gz *
```

This command will create a compressed tar file called `myfiles.tar.gz` containing all the files in the current directory.

Here is a list of the parts of the command and what they do:
- `tar`: The command for creating tar files.
- `-cf`: The flags for creating a tar file.
- `<filename>.tar`: The name of the tar file to be created.
- `<list of files>`: The list of files to be included in the tar file.
- `-z`: The flag for compressing the tar file.
