# How can I decide between using tar gzip and bzip2 for compressing files?
// plain

When deciding between using tar gzip and bzip2 for compressing files, there are a few factors to consider.

#### Example Code

```
tar -czvf file.tar.gz file
tar -cjvf file.tar.bz2 file
```

#### Explanation

The `-c` flag is used to create an archive, the `-z` flag is used to compress with gzip, and the `-j` flag is used to compress with bzip2.

#### Output

No output.

#### Pros and Cons

Gzip is generally faster to compress and decompress, but bzip2 produces a smaller compressed file size. Gzip is more widely used and supported, but bzip2 is better suited for compressing large files.
