# How do I unzip a tar file in Unix?
// plain

1. To unzip a tar file in Unix, you can use the `tar` command with the `-x` option.

2. For example, to unzip a file named `mytarfile.tar`, you can run the following command:

```
tar -xvf mytarfile.tar
```

3. The `-x` option tells the `tar` command to extract the contents of the file.

4. The `-v` option tells the `tar` command to verbosely list the files it is extracting.

5. The `-f` option tells the `tar` command to use the following argument as the name of the file to extract.

6. The output of the command should be a list of the files that were extracted from the tar file.

7. For more information, see the `tar` command manual page [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/tar_7.html).
