# How do I use gzip tar xvf to extract a file?
// plain

To use gzip tar xvf to extract a file, you need to use the following command:

```
tar xvfz <filename.tar.gz>
```

This command will extract the contents of the compressed file `<filename.tar.gz>` and create a directory with the same name as the file.

The command consists of several parts:
- `tar`: The tar command is used to create, modify, and extract files from an archive.
- `x`: The x switch tells tar to extract the archive.
- `v`: The v switch tells tar to be verbose and list the files it is extracting.
- `f`: The f switch tells tar to use the file following the switch as the archive.
- `z`: The z switch tells tar to use the gzip compression algorithm to decompress the archive.

Once the command is executed, you will see a list of files extracted from the archive.

Here is an example:

```
$ tar xvfz myfile.tar.gz
myfile/
myfile/file1.txt
myfile/file2.txt
myfile/file3.txt
```

For more information on the tar command, see [the tar man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tar).
