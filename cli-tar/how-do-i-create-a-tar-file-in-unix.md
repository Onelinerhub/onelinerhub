# How do I create a tar file in Unix?
// plain

Creating a tar file in Unix is a simple process. The following command will create a tar file from all the files and directories in the current directory:

```
tar -cvf my_files.tar *
```

This command will create a tar file called `my_files.tar` containing all the files and directories in the current directory.

The parts of the command are:

* `tar` - the command to create a tar file
* `-cvf` - the flags to create a tar file, verbosely list the files added, and name the tar file
* `my_files.tar` - the name of the tar file to create
* `*` - the argument to add all files and directories in the current directory

For more information, see the [GNU tar manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html).
