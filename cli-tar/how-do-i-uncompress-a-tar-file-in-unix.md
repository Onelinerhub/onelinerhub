# How do I uncompress a tar file in Unix?
// plain

The tar command in Unix can be used to uncompress a tar file. To do this, use the following command:
```
tar -xvf <filename>.tar
```
This will extract the files contained in the tar archive file into the current directory.

The code above has the following parts:
- `tar`: This is the tar command.
- `-xvf`: This is the option to extract files from the tar archive.
- `<filename>.tar`: This is the name of the tar file.

The output of this command will be the list of files that were extracted from the tar archive.
