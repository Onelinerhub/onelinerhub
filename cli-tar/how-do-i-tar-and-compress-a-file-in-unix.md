# How do I tar and compress a file in Unix?
// plain

Tarring and compressing a file in Unix is a two step process. First, the file is tarred using the `tar` command. Then, the tar file is compressed using a compression utility, such as `gzip` or `bzip2`.

For example, to create a tar file of the file `myfile.txt` and compress it with `gzip`, use the following command:

```
tar -czvf myfile.tar.gz myfile.txt
```

The output of this command will be:

```
myfile.txt
```

The parts of this command are:

- `tar`: The command to create a tar file
- `-czvf`: Options used to compress the file with `gzip` and create a verbose output
- `myfile.tar.gz`: The name of the tar file that will be created
- `myfile.txt`: The file that will be tarred and compressed

For more information on using the `tar` command, see the [GNU Tar Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html).
