Extracting a tar.gz file using the command line requires the use of the tar command. This command is used to create, modify, and extract tar archives.

The command to extract a tar.gz archive is as follows:

```
tar -xzvf <filename>.tar.gz
```

- `-xzvf`: The `-xzvf` options are used to extract the tar archive.
- `<filename>.tar.gz`: This is the name of the tar.gz archive that you want to extract.
