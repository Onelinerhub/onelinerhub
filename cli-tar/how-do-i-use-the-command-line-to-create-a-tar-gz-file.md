// plain

To create a tar.gz file using the command line, the following command can be used:

```
tar -czvf <file_name>.tar.gz <file_name>
```

The parts of the command are as follows:

- `tar`: The command used to create a tar file
- `-czvf`: Options used to create a tar file in gzip format with verbose output
- `<file_name>.tar.gz`: The name of the output tar file
- `<file_name>`: The name of the file to be compressed

The output of the command will be the newly created tar.gz file.
