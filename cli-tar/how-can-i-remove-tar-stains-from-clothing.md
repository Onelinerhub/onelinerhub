// plain

To remove tar stains from clothing, you can use a combination of oil and baking soda.

1. Start by gently scraping off as much of the tar as possible with a butter knife.

2. Then, apply a generous amount of oil (such as vegetable or olive oil) to the stained area.

3. Let the oil sit for a few minutes, then rub a generous amount of baking soda into the stained area.

4. Let the baking soda sit for a few minutes, then use a scrub brush to scrub the stained area.

5. Rinse the area with warm water.

6. If any of the stain remains, repeat the process until the stain is gone.

7. Finally, launder the clothing as usual.

```
Example code

oil = "vegetable oil"
baking_soda = "generous amount"

print("Apply " + oil + " to the stained area.")
print("Rub " + baking_soda + " into the stained area.")

```
## Output example


Apply vegetable oil to the stained area.
