# How do I unzip a file using the tar command in a shell?
// plain

The `tar` command can be used to unzip a file in a shell. The following example code block shows how to use the `tar` command to unzip a file named `example.tar.gz`:

```
tar -xzf example.tar.gz
```

This command will extract the contents of `example.tar.gz` into the current directory.

The code can be broken down as follows:
- `tar`: the command to unzip the file
- `-xzf`: the flags used to extract the contents of the file
- `example.tar.gz`: the name of the file to unzip

For more information about the `tar` command, you can refer to the following links:
