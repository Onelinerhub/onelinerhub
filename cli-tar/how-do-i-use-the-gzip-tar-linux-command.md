# How do I use the gzip tar Linux command?
// plain

The `gzip tar` Linux command is used to compress and combine multiple files into a single file. This command is useful for archiving multiple files into one file for easier storage or transfer.

To use the `gzip tar` command, you will need to provide the command with two arguments. The first argument is the `-cvzf` flag, which stands for create, verbose, gzip, and file. The second argument is the name of the file you want to create.

Here is an example of the command in use:
```
tar -cvzf my_archive.tar.gz file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
This command will create a file called `my_archive.tar.gz` which contains the files `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`.

The `-cvzf` flag can be broken down into four parts:
* `-c`: Create a new archive
* `-v`: Verbose output
* `-z`: Compress the archive with gzip
* `-f`: Specify the name of the archive

To extract the files from the archive, use the `tar -xvzf` command, replacing `-cvzf` with `-xvzf`.
