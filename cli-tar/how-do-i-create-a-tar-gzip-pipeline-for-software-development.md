# How do I create a tar gzip pipeline for software development?
// plain

A tar gzip pipeline for software development is a method of compressing and archiving software code and associated files into a single, compressed file. This makes it easier to share code between developers and to deploy software to production.

To create a tar gzip pipeline, use the `tar` command to create an archive of the files you want to compress. For example, to create a `.tar.gz` archive of a directory called `myproject`:

```
tar -zcvf myproject.tar.gz myproject
```

This command will create an archive called `myproject.tar.gz` that contains all the files and directories in `myproject`.

Once you have created the archive, you can use the `gzip` command to compress it further. To compress the `myproject.tar.gz` archive:

```
gzip myproject.tar.gz
```

This will create a compressed file called `myproject.tar.gz.gz` that is much smaller in size.

You can also use the `--exclude` flag to exclude certain files and directories from the archive. For example, to exclude a directory called `node_modules` from the archive:

```
tar -zcvf myproject.tar.gz --exclude=node_modules myproject
```

This will create an archive called `myproject.tar.gz` that does not contain the `node_modules` directory.

By combining the `tar` and `gzip` commands, you can create a tar gzip pipeline for software development that makes sharing and deploying code much easier.

## List of Code Parts

1. `tar -zcvf myproject.tar.gz myproject`: This command creates a `.tar.gz` archive of the directory `myproject`.
2. `gzip myproject.tar.gz`: This command compresses the `myproject.tar.gz` archive.
3. `tar -zcvf myproject.tar.gz --exclude=node_modules myproject`: This command creates an archive of `myproject` that excludes the `node_modules` directory.
