# How to use the Symfony console in PHP?
// plain

The Symfony Console is a powerful command line interface (CLI) for PHP applications. It allows developers to create and run commands from the command line.

To use the Symfony Console in PHP, you need to install the Symfony Console component. This can be done using Composer:

```
composer require symfony/console
```

Once the component is installed, you can create a new console application by creating a new class that extends the `Symfony\Component\Console\Application` class. This class will contain all of the commands that you want to run from the command line.

You can then register each command with the application using the `add()` method. Each command is an instance of the `Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command` class.

Finally, you can run the application by calling the `run()` method. This will parse the command line arguments and execute the appropriate command.
