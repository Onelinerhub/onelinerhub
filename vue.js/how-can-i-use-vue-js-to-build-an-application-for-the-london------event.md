# How can I use Vue.js to build an application for the London 2023 event?
// plain

Vue.js is a great tool for building applications for the London 2023 event. It provides an easy-to-use, reactive framework for creating dynamic, user-friendly interfaces. Here is an example of how to use Vue.js to build an application for the London 2023 event:

```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>London 2023 Event</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the London 2023 Event!</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'London2023Event'
}
</script>
```
This code creates a simple template with a heading and a paragraph of text.

The `<template>` tag is used to define the HTML content of the application. Inside this tag, we have a `<div>` tag which contains our heading and paragraph.

The `<script>` tag is used to define the JavaScript logic of the application. Inside this tag, we have an `export default` statement which creates an object with the name `London2023Event`.
