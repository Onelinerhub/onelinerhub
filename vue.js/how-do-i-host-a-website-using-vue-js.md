# How do I host a website using Vue.js?
// plain

Using Vue.js to host a website is a straightforward process.

First, you will need to install the Vue CLI. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Once installed, you can then create a new project by running the following command in your terminal:
```
vue create my-project
```

This will create a new project with the name `my-project`. You can then enter the project directory and start the development server by running the following command:
```
cd my-project
npm run serve
```

The development server will start and you can view your website at `http://localhost:8080`.

To deploy your website, you will need to build your project for production. You can do this by running the following command:
```
npm run build
```

This will generate a set of static files in the `dist` directory which you can then upload to your web server.
