# How do I use the Vue.js CLI?
// plain

The Vue.js CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool for creating and managing Vue.js projects. It can be used to quickly generate a new project, scaffold components, and build and serve the application.

To install the CLI, you can use npm or yarn:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

Once the CLI is installed, you can create a new project by running the `vue create` command:

```
vue create my-project
```

This will prompt you to choose a preset, then install dependencies and generate the project structure.

To scaffold a new component, you can use the `vue generate` command:

```
vue generate component my-component
```

This will create the component files and add them to the project.

Finally, you can build and serve the application with the `vue serve` command:

```
vue serve
```

This will build the application and serve it at `localhost:8080`.
