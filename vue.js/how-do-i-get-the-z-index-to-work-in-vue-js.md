# How do I get the z-index to work in Vue.js?
// plain

The `z-index` property in Vue.js is used to control the stacking order of elements. It is a CSS property that can be used to position elements in front of or behind other elements.

To use `z-index` in Vue.js, you can add the `z-index` property to the element's style. Here is an example:

```html
<template>
  <div style="z-index: 1;">
    My element
  </div>
</template>
```

This will cause the element to be positioned in front of other elements.

You can also use the `z-index` property in combination with other CSS properties, such as `position` and `display`, to further control the stacking order of elements. Here is an example:

```html
<template>
  <div style="z-index: 1; position: relative; display: block;">
    My element
  </div>
</template>
```

This will cause the element to be positioned relative to other elements, and will be displayed as a block element.

For more information about `z-index` in Vue.js, please refer to the [Vue.js Documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/z-index.html).
