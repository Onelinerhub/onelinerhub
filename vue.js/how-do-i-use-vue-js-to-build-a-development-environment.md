# How do I use Vue.js to build a development environment?
// plain

1. Setting up a Vue.js development environment is relatively easy and straightforward.
2. To begin, you'll need to install the Vue CLI, which is a command line tool for scaffolding Vue projects. You can do this by running the following command: `npm install -g @vue/cli`.
3. Once the CLI is installed, you can create a new project by running `vue create <project-name>`. This will create a new project with all the necessary files and folders.
4. Once the project is created, you can start the development server by running `npm run serve`. This will start a local development server with hot-reloading enabled.
5. You can then open `localhost:8080` in your browser to view the application.
6. You can also add plugins to your project, such as the Vue Router, by running `vue add <plugin-name>`.
7. Finally, you can build the project for production by running `npm run build`, which will create a minified version of the application in the `dist` folder.

Example code block:
```
// install Vue CLI
npm install -g @vue/cli

// create new project
vue create <project-name>

// start development server
npm run serve

// add plugin
vue add <plugin-name>

// build project for production
npm run build
```

Output of example code:

```
> vue create <project-name>

Vue CLI v4.2.3
? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
  default (babel, eslint)
❯ Manually select features

// ...

✔  Successfully created project <project-name>.
```
