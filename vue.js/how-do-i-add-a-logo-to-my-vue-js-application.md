# How do I add a logo to my Vue.js application?
// plain

To add a logo to a Vue.js application, you can use the `<img>` tag. The `src` attribute should point to the location of the logo image file.

For example:

```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo">
```

This will display the logo.png file located in the same directory as the HTML file.

## Code explanation

- `<img>`: An HTML tag used to display an image.
- `src`: An attribute of the `<img>` tag that specifies the location of the image file.
