# How do I create a file structure for my Vue.js project?
// plain

Creating a file structure for a Vue.js project is fairly simple. The basic structure of a Vue.js project consists of the following folders and files:

- `public`: This folder contains the `index.html` file which is the entry point of the application.
- `src`: This is the main folder which contains all the source code of the application, including the `main.js` file which is the entry point of the application.
- `node_modules`: This folder contains all the dependencies installed by NPM.
- `package.json`: This file contains all the project related information, such as the project name, version, dependencies, scripts, etc.

## Example code

```
// main.js
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  render: h => h(App)
})
```

## Output example
 No output.

## Code explanation

- `import Vue from 'vue'`: This line imports the Vue library.
- `import App from './App.vue'`: This line imports the App component from the App.vue file.
- `el: '#app'`: This line sets the root element of the application to the element with the id of `app`.
- `render: h => h(App)`: This line renders the App component.
