# How can I create a Kanban board using Vue.js?
// plain

Creating a Kanban board using Vue.js is a great way to manage tasks and projects. To do this, you'll need to create a few components that will make up the board.

First, create a `KanbanBoard` component that will contain all of the other components. This component will be responsible for rendering the board and keeping track of the tasks.

```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Kanban Board</h1>
    <div>
      <TaskList />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  components: {
    TaskList
  }
}
</script>
```

Next, create a `TaskList` component that will render each of the tasks. This component should contain a `v-for` loop that will iterate through the tasks and render a `Task` component for each one.

```
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-for="task in tasks" :key="task.id">
      <Task :task="task" />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ['tasks'],
  components: {
    Task
  }
}
</script>
```

Finally, create a `Task` component that will render the individual tasks. This component should contain the logic for dragging and dropping the tasks as well as any other logic related to the task.

```
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>{{ task.name }}</h2>
    <p>{{ task.description }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ['task'],
  methods: {
    // Logic for dragging and dropping task
  }
}
</script>
```

Once all of the components have been created, you can use them to render the Kanban board.

Parts of code:
- `KanbanBoard` component: responsible for rendering the board and keeping track of the tasks.
- `TaskList` component: renders each of the tasks using a `v-for` loop and a `Task` component.
- `Task` component: renders the individual tasks and contains the logic for dragging and dropping the tasks.
