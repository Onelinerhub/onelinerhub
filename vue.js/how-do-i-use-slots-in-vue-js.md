# How do I use slots in Vue.js?
// plain

Slots in Vue.js provide an easy way to pass HTML and other content into components.

To use slots, you first need to create a template for the component. Inside the template, you can define named slots using the `<slot>` element, and then pass content into those slots using the `v-slot` directive. Here is an example:

```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>My Component</h1>
    <slot name="content"></slot>
  </div>
</template>
```

Then, when you use the component, you can pass content into it using the `v-slot` directive:

```
<my-component>
  <template v-slot:content>
    <p>This is the content I want to pass into the component.</p>
  </template>
</my-component>
```

The content inside the `<template>` element will be passed into the component, and will be rendered in place of the `<slot>` element.

## Code explanation


- `<slot>` element: This is used to define the named slot in the component.
- `v-slot` directive: This is used to pass content into the slot.
