# How do I use the beforeUpdate hook in Vue.js?
// plain

The beforeUpdate hook in Vue.js is a function that is invoked before a component is updated. It is used to modify data, react to changes in data, or perform any other necessary operations before the component is re-rendered.

## Example

```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    data () {
      return {
        message: 'Hello World!'
      }
    },
    beforeUpdate () {
      this.message = 'Goodbye World!'
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Output example

```
Goodbye World!
```

The code above contains an example of the beforeUpdate hook in action. The `beforeUpdate` function is defined inside the component's `script` tag and is used to modify the `message` data property. The `message` property is then rendered in the `template` tag with an `h1` tag. When the component is updated, the `beforeUpdate` function is invoked, and the `message` property is changed from `Hello World!` to `Goodbye World!`, which is then rendered in the `h1` tag.

The parts of the code above are as follows:
- `<template>`: This tag contains the HTML that is rendered when the component is mounted.
- `<script>`: This tag contains the JavaScript code for the component.
- `export default`: This is the keyword used to export the component.
- `data()`: This is a function that returns the data properties of the component.
- `beforeUpdate()`: This is the hook that is invoked before the component is updated.
- `this.message`: This is the data property that is being modified in the `beforeUpdate` hook.
