# How can I build a single page application using Vue.js?
// plain

To build a single page application using Vue.js, you will need to use the Vue CLI. The Vue CLI is a command line tool that helps you quickly create and manage Vue projects.

To get started, install the Vue CLI globally on your machine:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Once installed, you can create a new project using the `vue create` command. This will prompt you to choose a preset or manually select features.

```
vue create my-app
```

You can now start the development server by running `npm run serve` in the project directory. This will serve your application at `localhost:8080` in the browser.

The following steps will help you build a single page application with Vue.js:

1. Install the Vue CLI
2. Create a new project
3. Write your Vue components
4. Configure the router
5. Register your components
6. Create the HTML page
7. Serve the application
