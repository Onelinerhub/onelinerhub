# How do I set up a GitHub repository for a Vue.js project?
// plain

1. First create a new repository on GitHub. This can be done by clicking the “+” symbol in the top right corner of the page and selecting “New repository”.

2. Initialize the repository with a README file and a .gitignore file for Vue.js. This can be done by selecting “Vue.js” from the list of .gitignore templates.

3. Create a local directory on your computer for the project and initialize it with a git repository. This can be done with the following command:

```
git init
```

4. Add the remote repository as the origin for the local repository. This can be done with the following command, replacing “[url]” with the URL of the remote repository:

```
git remote add origin [url]
```

5. Add the files to the local repository and commit them. This can be done with the following commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

6. Push the changes to the remote repository. This can be done with the following command:

```
git push -u origin master
```

7. The repository is now set up and ready to be used for the Vue.js project.
