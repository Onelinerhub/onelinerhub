How do I create a Vue.js tutorial on YouTube?
// plain

Creating a Vue.js tutorial on YouTube requires a few steps. First, you'll need to create a script for the video. This should include a brief introduction to the topic, a few code examples, and a conclusion.

Next, you'll need to create a video that follows the script. This can be done with a screen recording or by recording yourself talking about the topic.

Once the video is made, you'll need to upload it to YouTube. Make sure to include a description with relevant keywords and a link to the code used in the video.

In the video, you should include a few code examples and explain each part. You can use the following code block as an example:

```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'HelloWorld',
};
</script>
```

The code above will render the following output:
```
Hello, world!
```

The code consists of two parts: the `template` and the `script`. The `template` contains the HTML that will be rendered, and the `script` contains the JavaScript code that will be executed.

Finally, you should provide relevant links in the description of the video. This could include links to the official Vue.js documentation, additional tutorials, and the code used in the video.

Good luck creating your Vue.js tutorial on YouTube!
