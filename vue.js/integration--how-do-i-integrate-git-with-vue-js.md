How do I integrate Git with Vue.js?
// plain

Git can be integrated with Vue.js with the help of the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/). The CLI allows you to quickly scaffold a project and manage the project's dependencies. Additionally, the CLI provides a way to easily integrate Git into your project.

To integrate Git into your Vue.js project, first install the Vue CLI:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Once the CLI is installed, you can create a new project and integrate Git with the following command:

```
vue create my-project --git
```

This command will create a new project named `my-project` and initialize a Git repository inside it. You can then use the `git` command to commit changes and push them to a remote repository.

To get started with Git, you can use the following commands to commit changes to your project:

```
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push
```

The first command `git add .` will add all of the changes in the current directory to the staging area. The second command `git commit -m "initial commit"` will create a commit with the message `initial commit`. The last command `git push` will push the changes to a remote repository.

For more information on using Git with Vue.js, please see the [Vue CLI documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/git-version-control.html).
