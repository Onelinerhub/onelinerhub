How do I integrate Vue.js with WordPress?
// plain

Integrating Vue.js with WordPress is relatively straightforward. First, you need to include the Vue.js library in your WordPress project. This can be done by adding the following line of code to your functions.php file:

```
wp_enqueue_script('vuejs', 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js');
```

Once Vue.js is included, you can start building your components. For example, you could create a simple component that displays "Hello World!" like this:

```
<div id="app">
  {{ message }}
</div>

<script>
  var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      message: 'Hello World!'
    }
  })
</script>
```

This code will output the following:

```
Hello World!
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. The HTML element with the id "app" - this is where the component will be rendered.
2. The `{{ message }}` - this is the data that will be rendered in the HTML element.
3. The JavaScript code - this is where you create a new Vue instance, specify the HTML element to render the component in, and set the data to be rendered.
