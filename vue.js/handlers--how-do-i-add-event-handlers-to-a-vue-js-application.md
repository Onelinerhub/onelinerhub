How do I add event handlers to a Vue.js application?
// plain

Event handlers are an important part of any Vue.js application. Event handlers allow you to respond to user interactions such as clicks, mouse movements, and key presses. To add an event handler to a Vue.js application, you can use the `v-on` directive.

For example, if you want to respond to a button click, you can add the `v-on` directive to the button element like this:

```html
<button v-on:click="handleClick">Click Me</button>
```

You can then define the `handleClick` method in the `methods` object of your Vue instance:

```javascript
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      console.log('Button was clicked!');
    }
  }
});
```

When the user clicks the button, the `handleClick` method will be called and the output `Button was clicked!` will be logged to the console.

The `v-on` directive can also be used with other events such as `mouseover`, `keyup`, and `submit`. Additionally, you can use the `@` shorthand for the `v-on` directive to make your code more concise.

## Code explanation


- `v-on` directive: This directive is used to add event handlers to elements, and can be used with events such as `click`, `mouseover`, `keyup`, and `submit`.
- `handleClick` method: This is the method that will be called when the user clicks the button.
- `@` shorthand: This shorthand can be used as a shorter alternative to the `v-on` directive.
