# How do I choose between Vue.js and Svelte for my software development project?
// plain

Choosing between Vue.js and Svelte for your software development project depends on the type of project, the level of complexity, and the size of the team.

Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework that is easy to learn and use. It has a large community of developers who provide support and guidance. It is well-suited for small to medium-sized projects, and is great for rapid prototyping.

Svelte is a newer framework that is gaining popularity. It is more performant than Vue.js and is ideal for larger projects. It also requires less code to write, which makes it easier to learn and maintain.

To help you decide which framework is right for your project, here is an example of a simple application written in both Vue.js and Svelte:

**Vue.js**
```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello {{name}}!</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      name: 'World'
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
**Output**:
```
Hello World!
```

**Svelte**
```
<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>

<script>
  let name = 'World'
</script>
```

**Output**:
```
Hello World!
```

In conclusion, if you are looking for a simple, easy to use framework for a small to medium-sized project, Vue.js is a great choice. If you are looking for a more performant framework for a larger project, Svelte is the way to go.
