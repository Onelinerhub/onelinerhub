How can I generate a PDF from a Vue.js application using jsPDF?
// plain

To generate a PDF from a Vue.js application using jsPDF, you can use the following code example:

```
// Import jsPDF
import jsPDF from 'jspdf';

// Create a new jsPDF instance
const doc = new jsPDF();

// Add a title to the PDF
doc.text('My Vue.js Application', 10, 10);

// Generate the PDF
doc.save('my-vue-application.pdf');
```

This will create a PDF file named `my-vue-application.pdf` with the title `My Vue.js Application` at the top.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Importing the jsPDF library: This is done using the `import` keyword, which allows you to use the jsPDF library in your Vue.js application.
2. Creating a new jsPDF instance: This is done using the `new` keyword, which creates a new instance of the jsPDF library.
3. Adding a title to the PDF: This is done using the `text()` method, which adds text to the PDF.
4. Generating the PDF: This is done using the `save()` method, which saves the PDF to a file.

For more information on how to use the jsPDF library, you can refer to the [jsPDF documentation](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF).
