# How can I use the Vue.js DevTools beta?
// plain

The Vue.js DevTools beta is a powerful tool that can be used to inspect and debug Vue.js applications. It allows developers to inspect the component structure of the application, observe the current state and mutation of the application, and to interact with the application in real-time.

Here is an example of how to use the DevTools beta:

```
// import the Vue DevTools
import VueDevtools from '@vue/devtools'

// install the DevTools
Vue.use(VueDevtools)
```

This will open a new window in the browser with the DevTools. The DevTools has several tabs that can be used to inspect the application.

* **Components** tab: This tab shows the component tree of the application. It also shows the props and state of each component.
* **State** tab: This tab shows the current state of the application. It also allows developers to observe the mutation of the state.
* **Vuex** tab: This tab shows the state of the Vuex store. It also allows developers to observe the mutation of the store.
* **Events** tab: This tab shows the events that are emitted by the application.
