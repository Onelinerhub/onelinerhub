# How do I use the Vue.js playground to develop software?
// plain

The Vue.js Playground is an online editor that allows you to quickly develop and test Vue.js applications. It includes a code editor, a Vue.js instance, and a browser preview.

To use the Vue.js Playground to develop software, you first need to create a new project. You can do this by clicking the plus (+) icon in the top right corner of the page.

Once you have a project created, you can start writing code in the editor. For example, the following code creates a simple Vue.js application that displays "Hello World" in the browser:

```
<div id="app">
  {{ message }}
</div>

<script>
  new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      message: 'Hello World'
    }
  })
</script>
```

This code will produce the following output in the browser:

```
Hello World
```

The code consists of two parts:

1. The HTML markup, which defines the structure of the application.
2. The JavaScript code, which defines the behavior of the application.

Once you have written your code, you can click the "Run" button in the top right corner of the editor to preview the application in the browser.
