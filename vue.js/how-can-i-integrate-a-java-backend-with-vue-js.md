# How can I integrate a Java backend with Vue.js?
// plain

Integrating a Java backend with Vue.js is possible using the Java/Vue bridge library [Vue-Resource](https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource). Vue-Resource provides an API for making HTTP requests and handling responses from a server, which can be used to connect to a Java backend.

The following example code block shows how to use Vue-Resource to make a GET request to a Java backend, and then log the response to the console:
```javascript
this.$http.get('http://localhost:8080/api/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response);
  });
```

## Code explanation

* `this.$http.get`: This part of the code initializes the GET request.
* `('http://localhost:8080/api/data')`: This part of the code specifies the URL of the Java backend API endpoint.
* `.then(response => {`: This part of the code defines a callback function to be executed when the response from the server is received.
* `console.log(response);`: This part of the code logs the response to the console.
