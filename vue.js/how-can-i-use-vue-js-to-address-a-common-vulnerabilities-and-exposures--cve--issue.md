# How can I use Vue.js to address a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) issue?
// plain

Vue.js can be used to address Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) issues by using the built-in security features. For example, Vue.js provides a way to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by using the v-prevent-reload directive. This directive prevents the page from being reloaded when a form is submitted, which can help prevent CSRF attacks.

```html
<form v-prevent-reload>
  ...
</form>
```

The v-prevent-reload directive does not produce any output, but it can help protect against CSRF attacks.

Other security features that Vue.js provides include:

- **v-html** - This directive prevents HTML code from being injected into a page.
- **v-bind** - This directive prevents malicious code from being executed when data is bound to an element.
- **v-cloak** - This directive prevents HTML code from being displayed before the Vue.js application has been fully loaded.

These security features can be used to help protect against Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) issues.
