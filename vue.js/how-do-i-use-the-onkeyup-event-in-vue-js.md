# How do I use the onkeyup event in Vue.js?
// plain

The `onkeyup` event in Vue.js is used to call a function when a key is released. This event is typically used to trigger a function when a user has finished typing in an input field.

Here is an example of how to use the `onkeyup` event in Vue.js:

```
<input type="text" v-on:keyup="myFunction" />
```

```
methods: {
    myFunction: function() {
        console.log("A key was released");
    }
}
```

## Output example
 `A key was released`

The code above is made up of the following parts:

1. `<input type="text" v-on:keyup="myFunction" />` - this is the HTML input element which has an event listener attached to it using the `v-on` directive. The `v-on:keyup` tells Vue.js to call the `myFunction` function when a key is released.

2. `myFunction: function() {` - this is the function which is called when a key is released.

3. `console.log("A key was released");` - this is the code which is executed when the `myFunction` function is called.
