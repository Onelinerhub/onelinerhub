# How do I use the Vue.js Wiki?
// plain

The Vue.js Wiki is a great resource for learning and understanding how to use the JavaScript framework. It contains detailed documentation, tutorials, and examples of how to use Vue.js.

To use the Vue.js Wiki, first go to the [Vue.js Wiki Homepage](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/wiki). From there, you can navigate to the specific documentation you are looking for.

For example, if you wanted to learn how to use components, you would go to the Components section. From there, you can read about how to define components, how to use them in templates, and how to pass data between components.

Another example would be if you wanted to learn how to use directives. You would go to the Directives section and read about how to create and use custom directives, how to use built-in directives, and how to use the directive modifiers.

Finally, if you wanted to learn how to use the Vue.js CLI, you would go to the CLI section and read about how to install it, how to create projects, and how to use the various commands.

Here is an example of how to use a directive in a template:

```
<div v-if="show">
  This will be displayed if show is true
</div>
```

If `show` is `true`, the template will display `This will be displayed if show is true`.
