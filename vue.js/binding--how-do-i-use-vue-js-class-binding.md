How do I use Vue.js class binding?
// plain

Vue.js class binding allows you to dynamically bind class names to elements. This can be done by using the `v-bind:class` directive.

For example, to bind a class name called `active` to an element:

```html
<div v-bind:class="active"></div>
```

In the above example, the class `active` will be added to the element when the `active` data property is truthy.

You can also use an object to bind multiple classes to an element:

```html
<div v-bind:class="{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }"></div>
```

In the above example, the class `active` will be added to the element when the `isActive` data property is truthy, and the class `text-danger` will be added to the element when the `hasError` data property is truthy.

You can also use an array to bind multiple classes to an element:

```html
<div v-bind:class="[activeClass, errorClass]"></div>
```

In the above example, the classes specified in the `activeClass` and `errorClass` data properties will be added to the element.

You can also use the `v-bind:class` directive to conditionally apply a class. For example:

```html
<div v-bind:class="[{ active: isActive }, errorClass]"></div>
```

In the above example, the class `active` will be added to the element when the `isActive` data property is truthy, and the class specified in the `errorClass` data property will be added to the element.
