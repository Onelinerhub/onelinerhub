# How can I use Vue.js to implement image zooming on my website?
// plain

Vue.js can be used to implement image zooming on a website. To do this, you will need to use the `v-img` component. This component allows you to create an image that can be zoomed in and out.

## Example code

```
<v-img
  src="https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png"
  class="img-fluid"
  max-zoom="3"
  min-zoom="1"
/>
```

This code will create an image with a maximum zoom of 3x and a minimum zoom of 1x.

## Code explanation


- `v-img`: This component is used to create an image that can be zoomed in and out.
