How do I use the Vue.js keyup event?
// plain

The `keyup` event is a Vue.js event that is triggered when a key is released on the keyboard. It can be used to detect user input and respond accordingly.

To use the `keyup` event, you need to add a `@keyup` attribute to an element in the template. It should point to a method in the Vue instance that responds to the event.

For example, if you want to detect when the user presses the enter key and respond by logging a message to the console, you can do the following:

```
<input type="text" @keyup.enter="onEnterKeyPressed" />

...

methods: {
  onEnterKeyPressed() {
    console.log('The enter key was pressed!');
  }
}
```

When the user presses the enter key, the `onEnterKeyPressed` method will be called, and the message will be logged to the console.

You can also use the `keyup` event to detect the key that was pressed. To do this, you need to pass the `event` object to the method. The `event` object contains information about the key that was pressed.

For example, if you want to log the key that was pressed, you can do the following:

```
<input type="text" @keyup="onKeyPressed" />

...

methods: {
  onKeyPressed(event) {
    console.log(`The ${event.key} key was pressed!`);
  }
}
```

When the user presses a key, the `onKeyPressed` method will be called, and the key that was pressed will be logged to the console.
