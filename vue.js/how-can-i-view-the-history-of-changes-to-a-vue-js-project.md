# How can I view the history of changes to a Vue.js project?
// plain

To view the history of changes to a Vue.js project, you can use the `git log` command. This command will display a list of all the commits made to the project, along with the commit message and the author of the commit.

For example, the following command will display a list of commits made to a project:
```
$ git log
commit c8c9f7b8f5d7d5f4f3e2d1c0b9a8b7c6d5e4f3a2 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
Author: John Doe <john@example.com>
Date:   Thu Jul 9 14:15:00 2020 -0400

    Added new feature

commit b7b6a5a4a3b2b1a0c9f8e7d6c5d4e3f2g1h0i9j8
Author: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
Date:   Thu Jul 9 13:45:00 2020 -0400

    Fixed bug
```

The `git log` command also supports a variety of options that can be used to customize the output. For example, the `--oneline` option can be used to display each commit on a single line, and the `--author` option can be used to filter the output by author. For more information, see the [Git Log Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log).
