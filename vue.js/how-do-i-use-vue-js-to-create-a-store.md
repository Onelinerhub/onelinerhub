# How do I use Vue.js to create a store?
// plain

Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework for creating dynamic web applications. To create a store with Vue.js, you need to set up a few components.

1. **Vuex**: Vuex is a state management library for Vue.js applications. It helps you manage the data in your application and allows you to access it from any component.

2. **Vue Router**: Vue Router is a library for creating routes in your Vue.js application. It allows you to define different routes for different components.

3. **Store**: A store is a JavaScript object that contains the data for your application. You can use the Vuex library to create a store.

## Example code

```
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'

Vue.use(Vuex);

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment (state) {
      state.count++
    }
  }
})
```

This code creates a new Vuex store with a state object containing a count property. You can use the store to access and update the data in your application.

You can learn more about creating a store with Vue.js from the official Vue.js documentation: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/state-management.html
