How can I use Vue.js to create an object-relational mapping?
// plain

Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a technique for creating a virtual object database that can be used within a programming language. Vue.js provides an easy way to create an ORM with its [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) library. Vuex allows users to create a store object that is composed of state, getters, mutations, and actions.

The state is an object that contains the data for the application. Getters are functions that retrieve data from the state. Mutations are functions that modify the state, and actions are functions that can be used to commit mutations.

## Example code

```js
// store.js
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuex from 'vuex'

Vue.use(Vuex)

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    todos: [
      { id: 1, text: 'Learn Vuex', done: false }
    ]
  },
  getters: {
    doneTodos: state => {
      return state.todos.filter(todo => todo.done)
    }
  },
  mutations: {
    toggleTodo(state, todo) {
      todo.done = !todo.done
    }
  },
  actions: {
    toggleTodo({ commit }, todo) {
      commit('toggleTodo', todo)
    }
  }
})
```

This code creates a store object that contains a state, getters, mutations, and actions. The state contains an array of todos, the getters return an array of done todos, the mutations modify the state, and the actions commit the mutations.
