# How can I use Vue.js and Python Flask together to develop a web application?
// plain

Vue.js and Python Flask can be used together to develop a web application by creating a single page application (SPA) with Vue.js as the front end and using Python Flask as the back end.

The front end of the application can be developed using Vue.js components, HTML, and JavaScript. The back end of the application can be developed using Python Flask, which provides an API for the front end to communicate with.

## Example code


```
# main.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Output example


```
 * Serving Flask app "main" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Code explanation


- `from flask import Flask`: imports the Flask class from the flask module.
- `app = Flask(__name__)`: creates a new Flask instance.
- `@app.route('/')`: creates a route for the application.
- `def hello_world():`: defines a function that will be executed when the route is accessed.
- `return 'Hello, World!'`: returns a response to the browser.
- `if __name__ == '__main__':`: checks if the script is being run directly.
- `app.run()`: starts the Flask application.
