# How can I get Vue.js to be detected by Firefox?
// plain

1. In order to get Vue.js to be detected by Firefox, you will need to include a script tag in your HTML document.

2. The script tag should link to the Vue.js library, which can be downloaded from [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html).

3. Once the library is downloaded, you can add the script tag to your HTML document as follows:

```html
<script src="vue.js"></script>
```

4. This will enable Firefox to detect the Vue.js library and use it to render the page.

5. You can also use a CDN to include the Vue.js library in your HTML document. This can be done by adding the following script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
```

6. This will ensure that Firefox is able to detect the Vue.js library and use it to render the page.

7. To learn more about using Vue.js with Firefox, you can refer to the [Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html).
