# How can I use the Vue.js roadmap to plan my software development project?
// plain

The Vue.js roadmap is a great tool for planning software development projects. It provides an overview of upcoming features and changes to the framework, so you can plan ahead and make sure your project is up to date.

For example, if you were planning a project using Vue.js 3, you could use the roadmap to plan for the new features such as the Composition API, Fragments, and Teleport.

Here is an example of how you could use the roadmap to plan for the Composition API:

```
// Use the Composition API
import { ref, computed, watch } from 'vue'

// Create a ref to store the value
const count = ref(0)

// Create a computed value to double the count
const double = computed(() => count.value * 2)

// Watch the count and update the double value
watch(count, () => {
 double.value = count.value * 2
})
```

The output of this code would be a ref and computed value that double the count when it is updated.

The roadmap also provides links to official documentation and resources related to the feature, so you can familiarize yourself with it before implementing it in your project.
