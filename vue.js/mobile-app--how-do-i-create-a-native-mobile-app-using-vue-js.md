**Creating a native mobile app using Vue.js**

The first step to creating a native mobile app using Vue.js is to install the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html). This will allow you to create a new Vue project and add the necessary dependencies.

Once the Vue CLI is installed, you can create a new Vue project with the following command:

```
vue create my-app
```

This will create a new directory called `my-app` with the necessary files and dependencies.

Next, you will need to install the [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/) library, which allows you to create native mobile apps using Vue.js. To install Vue Native, you can run the following command in the `my-app` directory:

```
npm install vue-native-core
```

Once Vue Native is installed, you can create a new Vue Native component by creating a `.vue` file in the `my-app` directory. For example, you can create a `HelloWorld.vue` file with the following code:

```
<template>
  <view>
    <text>Hello World!</text>
  </view>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'HelloWorld'
}
</script>
```

This will create a simple `HelloWorld` component that displays the text "Hello World!".

Finally, you can run the following command to start the app in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the app in development mode and allow you to test it on your device.

With these steps, you can create a native mobile app using Vue.js.
