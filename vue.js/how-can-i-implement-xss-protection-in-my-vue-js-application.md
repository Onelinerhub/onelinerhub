# How can I implement XSS protection in my Vue.js application?
// plain

XSS protection in Vue.js applications can be implemented using Content Security Policy (CSP) and sanitization techniques.

CSP is a security policy that allows web applications to restrict the resources that can be loaded and executed. This prevents malicious scripts from being loaded and executed in the browser. To implement CSP in a Vue.js application, the `Content-Security-Policy` header should be set to a value that defines the allowed sources of scripts, stylesheets, images, and other resources. For example:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' https://example.com; script-src 'self' https://example.com; img-src 'self' https://example.com;
```

Sanitization is the process of preventing malicious code from being executed by removing potentially dangerous content. In Vue.js applications, this can be done by using the `v-html` directive to bind HTML content, and by using the `v-bind` directive to bind attributes.

For example, the following code will bind a string containing HTML as HTML content and will prevent any malicious code from being executed:

```
<div v-html="htmlString"></div>
```

The following code will bind an attribute to an element, and will prevent any malicious code from being executed:

```
<div v-bind:title="attributeString"></div>
```
