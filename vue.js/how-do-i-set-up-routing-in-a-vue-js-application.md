# How do I set up routing in a Vue.js application?
// plain

Setting up routing in a Vue.js application requires the use of a routing library. The official library for routing in Vue.js is Vue Router.

To install Vue Router, you can use npm or yarn:

```
# npm
npm install vue-router

# yarn
yarn add vue-router
```

Once Vue Router is installed, you will need to set up the routes for your application. To do this, create a `routes.js` file and define the routes you want to use:

```js
import Home from './views/Home.vue'
import About from './views/About.vue'

export default [
  {
    path: '/',
    component: Home
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    component: About
  }
]
```

Then, in the main `app.js` file, import the routes and use the `Vue.use()` method to configure Vue Router:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'
import routes from './routes.js'

Vue.use(VueRouter)

const router = new VueRouter({
  routes
})

new Vue({
  router
}).$mount('#app')
```

Finally, in the `app.vue` file, use the `<router-view>` component to render the routes:

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <router-view></router-view>
  </div>
</template>
```

By following these steps, you can set up routing in a Vue.js application.
