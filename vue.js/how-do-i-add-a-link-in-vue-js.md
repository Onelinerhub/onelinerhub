# How do I add a link in Vue.js?
// plain

Adding a link in Vue.js is quite simple. To do this, you need to use the `<router-link>` tag. This tag is used to create a link to a different route in your Vue application.

For example, here is a code block that creates a link to the About page in a Vue application:

```
<router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
```

This code will create a link that says "About" and when clicked, it will take the user to the About page.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `<router-link>`: This is the tag that is used to create a link in Vue.
2. `to="/about"`: This is the route that the link will take the user to. In this case, it is the About page.
3. `About`: This is the text that will be displayed for the link.

There are other attributes that can be used with the `<router-link>` tag, such as `replace` and `append`. You can read more about them in the [Vue Router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#router-link).
