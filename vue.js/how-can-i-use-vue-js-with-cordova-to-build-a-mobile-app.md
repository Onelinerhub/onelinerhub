# How can I use Vue.js with Cordova to build a mobile app?
// plain

Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It can be used with Cordova to build a mobile app. Here is an example of a simple Vue.js app that can be used with Cordova:

```
<template>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'HelloWorld'
}
</script>
```

This code will create a simple "Hello World" app. The `<template>` section contains the HTML that will be displayed. The `<script>` section contains the JavaScript code that will run when the app is launched.

To use this code with Cordova, you will need to install the Cordova CLI, create a Cordova project, and add the Vue.js framework. Once that is done, you can copy the code into the `index.html` file and run the app on a device or simulator.

## Code explanation


- `<template>`: This contains the HTML that will be displayed when the app is launched.
- `<script>`: This contains the JavaScript code that will run when the app is launched.
- `name: 'HelloWorld'`: This is the name of the Vue.js component that will be created.
