# How can I use the Vue.js devtools to debug my code?
// plain

The Vue.js devtools can be used to debug your code by providing an interactive environment with which you can inspect the state of your application. To use the devtools, you first need to install the [Vue.js devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) browser extension. Once installed, you can open the devtools by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac).

At the top of the devtools panel, you can select the Vue tab to view the state of your application. You can also use the devtools to step through your code line-by-line, set breakpoints, and view the values of variables at any given point in your code.

For example, given the following code:

```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let c = a + b;
console.log(c);
```

The output of the code would be `3`.

In the devtools, you can set a breakpoint on the line `let c = a + b;`, which will pause the code execution at that line. Then, you can inspect the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` in the devtools panel.

In addition, the devtools also provide a console for you to execute code directly in the context of your application. This can be useful if you need to test certain functionality or check the value of a variable.

Overall, the Vue.js devtools provide a powerful debugging environment for inspecting the state of your application and stepping through your code.
