# How can I quickly get started with Vue.js?
// plain

1. To quickly get started with Vue.js, you should first install the Vue CLI. This will allow you to create Vue projects and manage all the dependencies.

2. Once the Vue CLI is installed, you can create a new project using the command `vue create my-project`. This will create a new project with all the necessary files and dependencies.

3. After the project is created, you can open the `main.js` file and start writing your Vue code. Here is an example of a simple Vue application:

```javascript
// main.js
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  render: h => h(App)
})
```

4. You can also create components, which are reusable pieces of code, to use in your application. Here is an example of a simple component:

```javascript
// MyComponent.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>My Component</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent'
}
</script>
```

5. To learn more about how to use Vue, you can check out the official documentation [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

6. You can also find many tutorials and example projects on the web, such as [this one](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-an-app-with-vue-js).

7. Finally, you can join the Vue.js community to get help and advice from other Vue developers. You can find the community [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/community/).
