# How can I use Vue.js with Apache?
// plain

Vue.js can be used with Apache in a few different ways.

1. To serve a Vue.js application, you can use Apache as a reverse proxy to serve the application from a Node.js server. This can be done with the following Apache configuration:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
</VirtualHost>
```

2. You can also use Apache to serve static files generated by Vue.js. This can be done by adding the following configuration to your Apache virtual host:

```
Alias /static /path/to/static/files
<Directory /path/to/static/files>
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

3. Finally, you can use Apache as a web server for a single-page application (SPA) built with Vue.js. To do this, you need to add the following configuration to your Apache virtual host:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

This will ensure that all requests are routed to the `index.html` file, which is the entry point of the Vue.js application.

## List of Code Parts

1. ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives used to proxy requests to a Node.js server.
2. Alias directive used to map a URL to a directory containing static files generated by Vue.js.
3. Require directive used to allow access to the directory containing static files.
4. RewriteEngine, RewriteBase, RewriteRule and RewriteCond directives used to ensure that all requests are routed to the `index.html` file.
