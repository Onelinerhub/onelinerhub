How do I create a Vue.js style guide?
// plain

Creating a Vue.js style guide is a great way to ensure consistency in your codebase. The guide should include a set of coding conventions and best practices that should be followed when writing Vue.js code.

For example, the guide should include code formatting conventions such as:

```
// Use 2 spaces for indentation
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

The guide should also include code structure conventions such as:

- Components should be named using PascalCase (e.g. MyComponent).
- Component data should be declared as a `data()` function.
- Use `computed` properties for derived state.

The guide should also include best practices such as:

- Avoid using global state.
- Use `v-model` for two-way data binding.
- Use `v-if` instead of `v-show`.

Finally, the guide should include a list of relevant links such as:

- [Vue.js Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/)
- [Vue.js Best Practices](https://vuejs.org/v2/best-practices/)
- [Vue.js Coding Conventions](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/coding-conventions.html)
