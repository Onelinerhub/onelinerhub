# How can I use Vue.js to exploit a vulnerability?
// plain

Vue.js can be used to exploit a vulnerability by using a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. XSS attacks allow malicious code to be injected into a web page, which can then be executed by a user's browser. To exploit a vulnerability using Vue.js, an attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

For example, the following code could be used to inject a malicious script into a page:

```
<script>
  var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      message: 'Malicious Code'
    }
  });
</script>
```

This code would create a Vue instance that would render the message "Malicious Code" on the page. The attacker could then use the message to execute malicious code in the user's browser.

## Code explanation


1. Create a Vue instance using `new Vue()`
2. Set the element to render the instance to using `el`
3. Set the data to be rendered using `data`
4. Inject malicious code using `message`
