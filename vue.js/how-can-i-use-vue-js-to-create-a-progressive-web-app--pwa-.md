# How can I use Vue.js to create a Progressive Web App (PWA)?
// plain

Vue.js can be used to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) by leveraging the Vue CLI and the [PWA plugin](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/%40vue/cli-plugin-pwa). To get started, you can create a new Vue project with the Vue CLI:

```
$ vue create my-pwa
```

Once the project is created, you can add the PWA plugin to your project with the following command:

```
$ vue add pwa
```

The PWA plugin will add the necessary files and configurations to your project, such as a service worker, manifest.json, and other PWA-related configurations. You can then customize the configuration to suit your needs.

To test your PWA, you can run the following command:

```
$ npm run serve
```

This will serve your application on a local development server. You can then use a tool such as [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to test your PWA and ensure that it meets the requirements for a valid PWA.

Once your PWA is ready, you can deploy it to a hosting platform of your choice.
