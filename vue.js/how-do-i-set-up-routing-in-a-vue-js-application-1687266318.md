# How do I set up routing in a Vue.js application?
// plain

To set up routing in a Vue.js application, you need to use the [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).

First, you need to install the Vue Router library:
```
npm install vue-router
```

Then, you need to import the library into your main.js file:
```
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'
Vue.use(VueRouter)
```

Next, you need to define the routes in your application. For example, you can define a route to the Home component:
```
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home }
]
```

Then, you need to create a router instance and pass the routes to it:
```
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes
})
```

Finally, you need to add the router instance to your Vue instance:
```
new Vue({
  router
}).$mount('#app')
```

Now, you are ready to use the [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) in your application.
