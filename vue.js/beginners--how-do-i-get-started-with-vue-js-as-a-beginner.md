Getting started with Vue.js as a beginner is easy. To get started, you will need to install the Vue CLI. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Once Vue CLI has been installed, you can create a new Vue project by running the following command:

```
vue create my-project
```

This will prompt you to choose a preset, which will determine the project's initial configuration. After the project has been created, you can start the development server by running the following command in the project directory:

```
npm run serve
```

This will start a development server on port 8080. You can now open the project in your browser at http://localhost:8080.

To get started with coding in Vue, you can look at the official Vue documentation and tutorials. Additionally, there are many helpful resources online, such as tutorials, blogs, and videos.
