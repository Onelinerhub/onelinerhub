# How can I use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in a Vue.js application?
// plain

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a software architectural pattern used for structuring an application. It is commonly used with web applications and is a popular choice for frameworks such as Vue.js.

In a Vue.js application, the MVC pattern is implemented by separating the application into three parts: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model is responsible for data management, the View is responsible for displaying the data, and the Controller is responsible for handling user input.

The following code block is a simple example of how to use the MVC pattern in a Vue.js application:

```javascript
// Model
let user = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30
};

// View
let view = {
  render: function() {
    console.log(`Name: ${user.name}, Age: ${user.age}`);
  }
};

// Controller
let controller = {
  changeName: function(name) {
    user.name = name;
    view.render();
  }
};

// Output
Name: John Doe, Age: 30
```

In this example, the Model is the `user` variable, the View is the `view` object, and the Controller is the `controller` object. The Controller handles user input, such as changing the `user`'s name, and the View is responsible for displaying the data.
