# How can I use Vue.js frameworks to develop software?
// plain

Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It is easy to use and provides a great development experience.

To use Vue.js to develop software, you need to include the Vue library in your HTML page:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
```

Then, create a new Vue instance and set up the data and methods that will be used by the application:

```
var app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    message: 'Hello World!'
  },
  methods: {
    reverseMessage: function () {
      this.message = this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  }
})
```

Finally, create the HTML elements that will be used to display the data and call the methods:

```
<div id="app">
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
  <button @click="reverseMessage">Reverse Message</button>
</div>
```

When the button is clicked, the `reverseMessage` method will be called and the message will be reversed.
