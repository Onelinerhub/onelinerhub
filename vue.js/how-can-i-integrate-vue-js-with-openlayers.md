# How can I integrate Vue.js with OpenLayers?
// plain

Integrating Vue.js with OpenLayers is a great way to build interactive mapping applications. It allows developers to create beautiful, interactive maps with the help of Vue.js components. Here is an example of how to integrate Vue.js with OpenLayers:

```
// Create a Vue.js instance
var app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    map: null
  },
  mounted () {
    // Create an OpenLayers map
    this.map = new ol.Map({
      target: 'map',
      layers: [
        new ol.layer.Tile({
          source: new ol.source.OSM()
        })
      ],
      view: new ol.View({
        center: ol.proj.fromLonLat([0, 0]),
        zoom: 2
      })
    });
  }
});
```

This code creates a Vue.js instance and an OpenLayers map. The data object contains the `map` property, which is set to `null` initially. The `mounted()` method is called when the Vue.js instance is ready. In this method, an OpenLayers map is created and stored in the `map` property. The map is configured with an OSM layer and a view with a center point of the coordinates `[0, 0]` and a zoom level of `2`.
