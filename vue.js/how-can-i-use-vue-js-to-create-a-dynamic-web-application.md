# How can I use Vue.js to create a dynamic web application?
// plain

Vue.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It can be used to create dynamic web applications by leveraging its reactive components, data binding, and computed properties. Here is an example of how to use Vue.js to create a dynamic web application:

```html
<div id="app">
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>

<script>
  const app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      message: 'Hello Vue!'
    }
  })
</script>
```

## Output example


Hello Vue!

The code above includes the following parts:

1. The HTML element with an id of `app`, which is the root element of the Vue instance.
2. The `Vue` constructor, which creates the Vue instance and takes an options object.
3. The `el` option, which defines the root element of the Vue instance.
4. The `data` option, which contains the data for the Vue instance.
5. The `message` property, which is the data that is rendered in the view.
