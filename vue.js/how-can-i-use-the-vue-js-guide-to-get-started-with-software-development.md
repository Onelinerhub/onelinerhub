# How can I use the Vue.js guide to get started with software development?
// plain

The Vue.js guide is a great resource to get started with software development. It provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Vue.js, as well as a comprehensive guide to the syntax and usage of the framework.

To get started, you can use the official Vue.js guide to create a simple "Hello World" application. For example:

```
<div id="app">
  {{ message }}
</div>

<script>
  var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      message: 'Hello World!'
    }
  })
</script>
```

This code will render the following output:

```
Hello World!
```

The code consists of the following parts:

* `<div>` - The HTML element where the Vue application will be rendered.
* `{{ message }}` - The placeholder for the data that will be rendered.
* `var app = new Vue({...})` - The Vue instance which will control the application.
* `el: '#app'` - The element where the Vue application will be rendered.
* `data: { message: 'Hello World!' }` - The data that will be rendered.
