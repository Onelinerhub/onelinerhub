# How do I use Vue.js middleware?
// plain

Vue.js middleware is a powerful tool that allows you to customize the default behavior of a Vue.js application. It enables developers to write custom logic between the components of a Vue.js application and the underlying resources.

To use Vue.js middleware, you must first create a middleware function. This function should accept the context object as its first argument and can optionally accept an options object. The context object is an object that contains the data that is passed between the components of the Vue.js application.

For example, the following is a simple middleware function that logs the context object to the console:

```js
const logMiddleware = (context, options) => {
  console.log(context);
};
```

After creating the middleware function, you must register it with the Vue.js application. This can be done using the `use` method on the Vue instance. For example:

```js
const app = new Vue({
  // ...
});

app.use(logMiddleware);
```

The middleware function will be executed every time the application is rendered. It is important to note that the order in which the middleware functions are registered is important, as the functions will be executed in the same order.

Finally, the middleware function can be configured with an options object. This object can be used to pass additional data to the middleware function.
