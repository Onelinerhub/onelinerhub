// plain

To find the answer to your programming question using the Vue.js documentation, you can use the search bar provided to search for specific keywords. Alternatively, you can browse the documentation to find the answer.

For example, if you are looking for the answer to how to create a Vue component, you can type in the keyword “component” in the search bar. You should be able to find the answer in the documentation.

You can also find the answer to your programming question by reading the tutorials provided in the documentation. The tutorials are a great way to learn more about Vue.js and its components.

Below is an example code block for creating a Vue component:

```
<script>
  Vue.component('my-component', {
    template: '<div>This is a Vue component!</div>'
  })
</script>
```

The output of this code block will be a Vue component with the text “This is a Vue component!”.

## Code explanation


- `Vue.component('my-component', {` - This is the beginning of the Vue component definition. It takes in two parameters: the name of the component (in this case, `my-component`) and an object containing the component’s options.
- `template: '<div>This is a Vue component!</div>'` - This is the template option of the component. It defines the HTML markup that will be rendered when the component is used.
- `})` - This is the end of the component definition.
