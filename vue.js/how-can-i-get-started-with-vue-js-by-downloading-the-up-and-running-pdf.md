Getting started with Vue.js is easy. You can download the up and running PDF from the [Vue.js official website](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

The PDF provides a comprehensive introduction to Vue.js, including the core concepts, syntax, and usage. It will also provide you with a basic understanding of how to create and maintain a Vue.js project.

Here is a basic example of creating a Vue.js project:

```
# Create a project directory
mkdir my-vue-project

# Move into the project directory
cd my-vue-project

# Install the Vue CLI
npm install -g @vue/cli

# Create a project
vue create .
```

Once the project is created, you can open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the Vue.js app.

The PDF also includes a section on advanced topics such as components, directives, and routing. It also includes a list of resources for further learning.

By following the instructions in the PDF, you can get up and running with Vue.js quickly and easily.
