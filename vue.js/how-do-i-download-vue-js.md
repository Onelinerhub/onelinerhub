// plain

Vue.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces and single page applications. You can download Vue.js from its official website, [https://vuejs.org/](https://vuejs.org/).

The easiest way to get started with Vue is to include the library from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). This can be done by adding the following script tag to your HTML page:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can install Vue using a package manager. For example, if you are using npm, you can run the following command:

```
$ npm install vue
```

This will install the latest version of Vue in your project's `node_modules` directory. You can then include it in your project using a `<script>` tag, or by using a bundler such as Webpack or Browserify.

You can also download the Vue source code directly from GitHub. The source code can be found at [https://github.com/vuejs/vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue).

Once you have downloaded the source code, you can build it using a build tool such as Gulp or Grunt. This will generate a `vue.js` file which you can then include in your project.

Finally, you can also use a pre-built version of Vue. Pre-built versions of Vue are available for download from [https://vuejs.org/js/](https://vuejs.org/js/).

These are the different ways you can download and use Vue.js in your project.
