# How do I obtain a Vue.js certification?
// plain

In order to obtain a Vue.js certification, you must complete a course offered by an accredited institution. Many universities, coding bootcamps, and online learning platforms offer courses and certifications in Vue.js.

For example, [Vue School](https://vueschool.io/) offers a certification program which includes a series of online courses and a final exam. After completing the courses and passing the exam, you will receive a Vue.js certification.

Below is a code block example of a simple Vue.js application:

```html
<div id="app">
  {{ message }}
</div>

<script>
  const app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
      message: 'Hello Vue!'
    }
  })
</script>
```

The code block above creates a Vue instance with an element and data property. The element property is the `#app` div and the data property is the `message` string. When the application is rendered, the `message` string will be displayed in the `#app` div.
