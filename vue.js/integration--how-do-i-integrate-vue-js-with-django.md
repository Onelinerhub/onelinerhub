How do I integrate Vue.js with Django?
// plain

Integrating Vue.js with Django is a straightforward process that consists of several steps.

First, you need to install Vue.js and its dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npm install vue
```

Once the installation is complete, you need to create a Vue.js project. You can do this by running the following command:

```
vue create my-project
```

Once the project is created, you need to configure it to work with Django. You can do this by adding the following code to your `settings.py` file:

```python
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'my-project/dist')
]
```

Then, you need to create a Django view to serve the Vue.js application. You can do this by adding the following code to your `views.py` file:

```python
def index(request):
    return render(request, 'my-project/index.html')
```

Finally, you need to create a template for the Django view. You can do this by adding the following code to your `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Project</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="{% static 'js/app.js' %}"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This will enable you to serve your Vue.js application with Django.
