How can I handle keydown events in Vue.js?
// plain

In Vue.js, keydown events can be handled by using the `v-on` directive. This directive can be used to attach an event listener that listens for keydown events. The syntax for using `v-on` is as follows:

```
<div v-on:keydown="handleKeyDown($event)">
  ...
</div>
```

The `handleKeyDown` function will be called when a keydown event is detected. The `$event` parameter will contain information about the keydown event, such as the key code. The `handleKeyDown` function can then use this information to handle the keydown event. For example:

```
function handleKeyDown(e) {
  if (e.keyCode === 13) {
    console.log('Enter key was pressed!');
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `handleKeyDown` function checks the key code of the keydown event (`e.keyCode`). If the key code is `13`, then the `Enter` key was pressed and a message is logged to the console.

## Code explanation
**

1. `<div v-on:keydown="handleKeyDown($event)">` - This attaches an event listener to the element that listens for keydown events and calls the `handleKeyDown` function when a keydown event is detected.
2. `handleKeyDown(e) {` - This is the function that will handle the keydown event. It takes the `$event` parameter which contains information about the keydown event.
3. `if (e.keyCode === 13)` - This checks the key code of the keydown event.
4. `console.log('Enter key was pressed!')` - This logs a message to the console if the `Enter` key was pressed.
