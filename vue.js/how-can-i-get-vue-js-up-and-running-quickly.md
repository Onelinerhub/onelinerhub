# How can I get Vue.js up and running quickly?
// plain

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It can be used to create single-page applications and complex web applications.

To get Vue.js up and running quickly, you can use the Vue CLI. The Vue CLI is a command line interface for quickly scaffolding Vue.js projects.

To install the Vue CLI, run the following command:

```
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Once the Vue CLI is installed, you can create a new project by running the following command:

```
$ vue create my-project
```

This will create a new project called `my-project` in the current directory. You can then start the development server by running the following command:

```
$ cd my-project
$ npm run serve
```

The development server will start and you can view your Vue.js application in the browser at http://localhost:8080.

You can also use the Vue CLI to quickly add plugins and libraries to your project. The Vue CLI has a number of built-in plugins and libraries that can be installed with a single command.
