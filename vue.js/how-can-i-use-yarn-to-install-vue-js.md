// plain

Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that can be used to install Vue.js.

To install Vue.js using Yarn, open a command prompt and enter the following command:

```
yarn add vue
```

This will download and install Vue.js and its dependencies to the local project.

The command consists of the following parts:

* `yarn` - The Yarn package manager.
* `add` - The command used to install packages.
* `vue` - The name of the package to be installed.

Once the command has been executed, the output should be similar to the following:

```
yarn add vue
success Saved 1 new dependency.
```

For more information on using Yarn, please refer to the [Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/).
