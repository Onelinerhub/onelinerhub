# How do I use a Vue.js builder to create a web application?
// plain

Creating a web application with Vue.js is easy and efficient with the use of a Vue.js builder. A Vue.js builder is a tool that helps to create a Vue.js application quickly and easily.

To use a Vue.js builder, first create a new project in the builder. Then, add components to the project. Components are the building blocks of a Vue.js application. Components can be added from the Vue.js library or from third-party libraries.

Once components have been added to the project, they can be configured. This includes setting properties, adding event handlers, and adding styling.

Finally, the application can be tested and deployed.

## Example code

```
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="handleClick">Click Me!</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      alert('You clicked the button!');
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

Output of example code:

When the button is clicked, an alert will appear that says "You clicked the button!"

## Code explanation


1. `<template>`: This is the HTML template for the component. It defines the structure of the component.

2. `<div>`: This is a container element that wraps the button element.

3. `<button>`: This is the button element.

4. `@click`: This is an event handler that will be triggered when the button is clicked.

5. `handleClick()`: This is a method that will be called when the button is clicked. It displays an alert with the message “You clicked the button!”
