# How can I use keyboard events in Vue.js?
// plain

Using keyboard events in Vue.js is done by using the `v-on` directive. The `v-on` directive allows you to attach an event listener to an element. You can listen for the `keyup` event, which is triggered every time a key is released.

For example, if you want to run a method when the `Enter` key is pressed, you can use the following code:

```
<input type="text" v-on:keyup.enter="runMethod" />
```

In this example, the `runMethod` method will be called whenever the `Enter` key is pressed.

You can also use the `keyCode` attribute to determine which key was pressed. For example, if you want to run a method when the `Enter` key is pressed, you can use the following code:

```
<input type="text" v-on:keyup="runMethod($event.keyCode)" />
```

In this example, the `runMethod` method will be called whenever any key is pressed, and the `keyCode` attribute will be passed as an argument. You can then use the `keyCode` attribute to determine which key was pressed.

You can also use the `keyup.enter` syntax to listen for specific key presses. For example, if you want to run a method when the `Enter` key is pressed, you can use the following code:

```
<input type="text" v-on:keyup.enter="runMethod" />
```

In this example, the `runMethod` method will be called whenever the `Enter` key is pressed.
