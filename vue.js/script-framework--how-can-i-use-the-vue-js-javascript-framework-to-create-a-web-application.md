Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. To create a web application with Vue.js, you can use the following steps:

1. Install the Vue CLI (Command Line Interface) globally on your machine.

```
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
```

2. Create a new project with the Vue CLI.

```
$ vue create my-project
```

3. Navigate to the project directory and start the development server.

```
$ cd my-project
$ npm run serve
```

4. Open the project in your favorite code editor and start creating components, adding routes, and writing logic.

5. When you have finished developing the application, build it for production.

```
$ npm run build
```

6. Deploy the built application to a web server.

7. Test the application and make sure it's working as expected.
