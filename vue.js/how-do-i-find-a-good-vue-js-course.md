# How do I find a good Vue.js course?
// plain

Finding a good Vue.js course can be a daunting task, but there are several resources available to help.

The first step is to decide what type of course you are looking for. Do you want to learn the basics, or do you want to dive deep into the more advanced concepts? Once you have decided on the type of course you want, there are several places to look for one.

The official Vue.js website has a [list of courses](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html#Courses) that are recommended by the Vue.js team. Additionally, there are many online courses available on websites such as Udemy, Pluralsight, and Coursera.

You can also find courses on specific topics such as state management, routing, and testing. For example, here is a [course on state management](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuex-in-depth/) which covers the fundamentals of Vuex.

Finally, there are also several books available on Vue.js, such as the [Vue.js Up and Running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/vuejs-up-and/9781491991764/) book by Callum Macrae.

```
// Example code
const message = 'Hello World!';
console.log(message);
```

```
// Output
Hello World!
```

- `const message = 'Hello World!';`: This statement creates a constant variable called `message` and assigns it the value `Hello World!`.
- `console.log(message);`: This statement logs the value of the `message` variable to the console.
