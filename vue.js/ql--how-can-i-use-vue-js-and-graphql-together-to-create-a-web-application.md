How can I use Vue.js and GraphQL together to create a web application?
// plain

Vue.js and GraphQL can be used together to create a web application. First, install the necessary packages, such as `vue-apollo` and `apollo-boost`, which provide the integration between Vue and GraphQL. Then, create a new Vue instance and define the GraphQL client in the `apollo` option. An example of this is shown below:

```js
const apolloProvider = new VueApollo({
  defaultClient: new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql'
  })
})

const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  apolloProvider
})
```

Next, create a query or mutation to send to the GraphQL server. This can be done using the `gql` function from `graphql-tag` package. An example of this is shown below:

```js
const query = gql`
  query {
    posts {
      title
      body
    }
  }
`
```

Finally, use the `apollo` object from `vue-apollo` to execute the query or mutation. An example of this is shown below:

```js
this.$apollo.query({ query }).then(result => {
  // Do something with the result
})
```

The following parts are included in the above example code:

1. `VueApollo`: This is a constructor function that creates a new Apollo client instance.
2. `ApolloClient`: This is a constructor function that creates a new Apollo client instance.
3. `uri`: This is the URI of the GraphQL server.
4. `gql`: This is a function from the `graphql-tag` package that creates a GraphQL query or mutation.
5. `query`: This is the GraphQL query or mutation.
6. `$apollo`: This is an object from `vue-apollo` that is used to execute the query or mutation.
