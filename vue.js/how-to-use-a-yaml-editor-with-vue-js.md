# How to use a YAML editor with Vue.js?
// plain

Using a YAML editor with Vue.js is a great way to quickly and easily create and edit YAML files. Here is an example of how to use a YAML editor with Vue.js:

```
<template>
  <div>
    <yaml-editor :data="yamlData" @input="onYamlChange" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import YAMLEditor from "vue-yaml-editor";

export default {
  components: {
    YAMLEditor
  },
  data() {
    return {
      yamlData: {
        name: "My App",
        version: "1.0.0"
      }
    };
  },
  methods: {
    onYamlChange(data) {
      this.yamlData = data;
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

This example code creates a `YAMLEditor` component, which is used to edit YAML data. The `data` property is used to provide the initial data for the YAML editor. The `@input` event is used to listen for changes to the YAML data and update the `yamlData` property accordingly.

The following are the parts of the example code:

1. `<template>`: This is the HTML template for the component.
2. `<script>`: This is the JavaScript code for the component.
3. `import YAMLEditor`: This imports the `YAMLEditor` component from the `vue-yaml-editor` package.
4. `data()`: This is the initial data for the YAML editor.
5. `methods`: This is the `onYamlChange` method, which is used to update the `yamlData` property when the YAML data is changed.
