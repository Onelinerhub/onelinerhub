# How can I use Nuxt.js with Vue.js?
// plain

Nuxt.js is a framework built on top of Vue.js that provides a powerful toolset for creating universal web applications. It is designed to make the development of modern web applications faster and easier, and to provide a great starting point for building universal Vue.js applications.

To use Nuxt.js with Vue.js, you first need to install the Nuxt.js package. You can do this with the following command:

```
npm install nuxt
```

Once Nuxt.js is installed, you can create a new Nuxt.js project by running the following command:

```
npx create-nuxt-app <project-name>
```

This will create a new Nuxt.js project in the directory specified by the <project-name> argument. Once the project is created, you can start the development server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open a browser window with your Nuxt.js project. You can then start writing your application code in the `pages` directory. Nuxt.js will automatically detect and compile your code as you write it.

To start using Vue.js with your Nuxt.js project, you can add the following line to your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```js
modules: [
  '@nuxtjs/vuetify'
]
```

This will enable the Vuetify module, which will allow you to use Vue.js components in your Nuxt.js project. You can then use these components in your pages and layouts, just like you would in a regular Vue.js application.
