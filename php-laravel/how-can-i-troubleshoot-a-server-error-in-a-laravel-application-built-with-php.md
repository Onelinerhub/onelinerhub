# How can I troubleshoot a server error in a Laravel application built with PHP?
// plain

1. First, check the application log files for any errors. These are usually located in the `storage/logs` directory.
2. Inspect the code for any syntax errors. To do this, you can use a linter such as [PHP CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).
3. Check the application configuration files for any typos or incorrect settings.
4. Check the database connection settings in the `.env` file.
5. Check the application routes for any typos or incorrect settings.
6. Test the application with the `php artisan serve` command to see if the error persists.
7. If the error persists, you can debug the application with [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/).

Example code block:
```php
<?php
echo "Hello World!";
```

## Output example

```
Hello World!
```
