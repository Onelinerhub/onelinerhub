// plain

To develop a website using PHP with Laravel, you can follow the steps below:

1. Install the Laravel framework:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel myproject
```

2. Create a database and configure your .env file with the database credentials:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=myproject
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

3. Create a controller:

```
php artisan make:controller HomeController
```

4. Create routes to the controller:

```
Route::get('/', 'HomeController@index');
```

5. Create a view file in the `resources/views` directory:

```
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```

6. Add the view to the controller:

```
public function index()
{
    return view('home.index');
}
```

7. Run the development server:

```
php artisan serve
```

This will start a development server at http://localhost:8000 and serve your application.

For more information on developing with Laravel, you can refer to the [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x).
