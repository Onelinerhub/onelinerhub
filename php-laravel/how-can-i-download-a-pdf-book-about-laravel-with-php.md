The easiest way to download a PDF book about Laravel with PHP is to use a package manager such as [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

For example, if you wanted to download a PDF book called "Laravel and PHP: A Comprehensive Guide" you could run the following command:

```
composer require laravel-php-guide
```

This command would install the package and download the PDF book to the current directory.

Alternatively, you could find the PDF book online and download it directly. There are many websites that offer free PDF books about Laravel and PHP, such as [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/).
