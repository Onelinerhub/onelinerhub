How can I use an if statement in Laravel with PHP?
// plain

An `if` statement is a fundamental part of programming in PHP, and is used in Laravel as well. It allows for certain code to be executed only when a certain condition is met. Here is an example of an `if` statement in Laravel using PHP:

```
if ($age >= 18) {
    echo 'You are old enough to vote.';
}
```

This code will output `You are old enough to vote.` if the value of `$age` is greater than or equal to 18.

The parts of this code are:

- `if`: the keyword that indicates the start of the `if` statement
- `($age >= 18)`: the condition that must be met in order for the code within the `if` statement to execute
- `echo 'You are old enough to vote.';`: the code that will be executed if the condition is met
- `}`: the keyword that indicates the end of the `if` statement
