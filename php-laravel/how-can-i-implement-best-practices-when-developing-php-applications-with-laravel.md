# How can I implement best practices when developing PHP applications with Laravel?
// plain

1. Follow the [Laravel coding standards](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/contributions#coding-style) when writing code. This includes using the [PSR-2 coding style](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and [PSR-4 autoloading standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).
2. Use [dependency injection](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/container#introduction) to manage your objects and classes. This will help improve the testability of your code.
3. Use [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent) to access your database. This will provide an easy to use interface to your database and help keep your code DRY.
4. Use [Blade templating](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/blade) to separate your business logic from your presentation layer. This will make your code more maintainable in the long run.
5. Use [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/mix) to manage your asset compilation. This will help streamline the process of compiling and minifying your CSS and JavaScript.
6. Use [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/dusk) to write automated browser tests. This will help ensure that your application is working correctly in different browsers.
7. Use [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) to manage your server configuration. This will help ensure that your server is properly configured and secure.

Example code block:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function show(Request $request, $id)
    {
        $user = User::findOrFail($id);

        return view('users.show', [
            'user' => $user,
        ]);
    }
}
```
