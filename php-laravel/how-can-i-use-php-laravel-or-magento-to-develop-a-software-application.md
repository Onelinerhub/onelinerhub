PHP Laravel and Magento are both powerful frameworks for developing software applications.

Using PHP Laravel, you can create a software application by following these simple steps:

1. Install the Laravel framework and create a new project:
```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel myproject
```
2. Create your Models and Controllers to define the application logic:
```
php artisan make:model Post
php artisan make:controller PostController
```
3. Create your Views to define the user interface:
```
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
4. Connect your Models and Controllers to the Views:
```
Route::get('/', 'PostController@index');
```
5. Configure your database and run your migrations:
```
php artisan migrate
```
