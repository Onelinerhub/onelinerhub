// plain

The PHP Laravel documentation is an invaluable resource when developing software. It contains all the information needed to understand the framework and develop applications.

To get started, you should begin by reading the [Installation Guide](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation). This will provide instructions on how to install the framework and create a new project.

Once the project is created, you can start developing your application. You should read through the [Basic Concepts](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation) section of the documentation to understand the fundamentals of the framework.

You can also find detailed information on how to use the various components of the framework. For example, the [Routing](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/routing) section explains how to create routes and use them to define the application's URLs.

You can also find code examples in the documentation. For example, the following code creates a new route and renders a view:

```
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

Finally, the documentation also contains a [Reference](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/reference) section which provides detailed information on the classes and methods available in the framework.

By using the PHP Laravel documentation, you can develop software quickly and efficiently.
