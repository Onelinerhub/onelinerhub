Learning PHP Laravel with W3Schools is a great way to get started.

To begin, you can start by exploring the [PHP Laravel Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/laravel/default.asp) page. This page provides a comprehensive overview of the framework, and includes a list of tutorials, references, and examples to help you get started.

You can also explore the [PHP Laravel Examples](https://www.w3schools.com/laravel/laravel_examples.asp) page. This page includes a variety of example code snippets, along with their output, to help you understand how to use the framework. For example, the following code block creates a simple route in a Laravel application:

```
Route::get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});
```

## Output example

```
Hello World
```

The code block above uses the `Route::get()` method to create a route with a URL of '/' and a callback function that returns the string "Hello World".

If you want to learn more about the framework, you can also explore the [PHP Laravel Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/laravel/laravel_ref_overview.asp) page. This page provides a comprehensive list of the components and methods of the framework, along with explanations and examples.

Finally, W3Schools also provides a [PHP Laravel Quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=Laravel) to help you test your knowledge.

By using the resources provided by W3Schools, you can quickly learn the basics of PHP Laravel and start building your own applications.
