// plain

Laravel and Symfony are two of the most popular frameworks for developing applications with PHP. Both frameworks offer a range of features and tools to make development easier and faster.

Laravel is an open-source PHP framework that is designed to make development easier and faster. It provides a range of features such as an expressive syntax, object-oriented libraries, and an intuitive interface. It also provides tools such as Artisan, a command-line interface, and Eloquent ORM, an object-relational mapper.

Symfony is also an open-source PHP framework that is designed to make development easier and faster. It provides a range of features such as a powerful routing system, a dependency injection container, and a templating engine. It also provides tools such as the Symfony Console, a command-line interface, and Doctrine, an object-relational mapper.

When comparing Laravel and Symfony, it is important to consider the specific requirements of the application. For example, if the application requires a powerful routing system, Symfony may be the better choice. On the other hand, if the application needs an intuitive interface and expressive syntax, Laravel may be the better choice.

Below is an example of code written in Laravel:

```
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

This code will render a welcome view when the application is accessed from the root URL.

When comparing Laravel and Symfony, there are a few key differences to consider. Laravel is designed to be more intuitive and less complex, while Symfony is designed to be more powerful and feature-rich. Additionally, Laravel offers more flexibility and is easier to learn, while Symfony is more robust and has more features.
