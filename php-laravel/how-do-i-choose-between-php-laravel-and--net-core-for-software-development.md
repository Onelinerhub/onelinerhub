# How do I choose between PHP Laravel and .NET Core for software development?
// plain

Choosing between PHP Laravel and .NET Core for software development largely depends on the specific needs of the project.

For example, if the project requires an intuitive and user-friendly interface, then PHP Laravel is the way to go, as it is designed for rapid development and offers a variety of robust features. On the other hand, if the project requires a more powerful and scalable backend, then .NET Core is the better choice, as it offers a wide range of features and is compatible with many different platforms.

Here is an example of a simple “Hello World” program written in PHP Laravel:

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class HelloWorldController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
```

## Output example

```
Hello World!
```

The code above is a controller class which contains an index method that simply returns the string “Hello World!”.

Here is an example of a similar “Hello World” program written in .NET Core:

```
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Output example

```
Hello World!
```

The code above is a class containing a Main method which simply prints the string “Hello World!” to the console.

Ultimately, the decision of which technology to use should be based on the specific needs of the project.
