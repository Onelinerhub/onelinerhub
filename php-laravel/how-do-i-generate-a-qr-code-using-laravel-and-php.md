# How do I generate a QR code using Laravel and PHP?
// plain

Generating a QR code using Laravel and PHP is a straightforward process. To do so, you will need to install the BaconQrCode package. This can be done through the command line using the following command:

```
composer require bacon/bacon-qr-code
```

Once installed, you can use the following code block to generate a QR code:

```
use BaconQrCode\Renderer\Image\Png;
use BaconQrCode\Writer;

$renderer = new Png();
$writer = new Writer($renderer);
$writer->writeFile('my_text', 'qrcode.png');
```

This will generate a `qrcode.png` file containing the QR code.

The code consists of the following parts:
1. `use BaconQrCode\Renderer\Image\Png`: This imports the Png renderer from the BaconQrCode package.
2. `use BaconQrCode\Writer`: This imports the Writer class from the BaconQrCode package.
3. `$renderer = new Png()`: This creates a new Png renderer instance.
4. `$writer = new Writer($renderer)`: This creates a new Writer instance and passes the renderer instance to it.
5. `$writer->writeFile('my_text', 'qrcode.png')`: This writes the QR code to a file called `qrcode.png` with the text `my_text`.
