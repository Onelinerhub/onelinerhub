# How do I create a course using PHP and Laravel?
// plain

Creating a course using PHP and Laravel is a relatively straightforward process. The first step is to create a new Laravel project. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:
```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel myproject
```
This will create a new folder called `myproject` containing the Laravel project.

The next step is to create a controller for the course. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:
```
php artisan make:controller CourseController
```
This will create a new controller file, `CourseController.php`, in the `app/Http/Controllers` folder.

The `CourseController.php` file can then be edited to add the necessary routes and logic for the course. For example, to create a route that displays the course page, the following code could be used:
```php
Route::get('/course', 'CourseController@index');

public function index()
{
    return view('course.index');
}
```

Finally, the view file for the course page can be created in the `resources/views/course` folder. This view can contain the HTML and logic for displaying the course page.

These steps should provide a basic overview of how to create a course using PHP and Laravel. For more information, please refer to the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x).
