# How can I integrate Stripe with my Laravel application using PHP?
// plain

Integrating Stripe with a Laravel application using PHP is a relatively straightforward process. The following steps will guide you through the process:

1. Sign up for a Stripe account and obtain your API keys.

2. Install the Stripe PHP library by running the following command:
```
composer require stripe/stripe-php
```

3. Create a Stripe charge using the Stripe PHP library. The following code example demonstrates how to create a charge of $10 USD:
```
<?php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

\Stripe\Stripe::setApiKey('your_stripe_secret_key');

$charge = \Stripe\Charge::create([
    'amount' => 1000,
    'currency' => 'usd',
    'description' => 'Example charge',
]);

echo $charge;
```
## Output example
 `Stripe\Charge JSON: { ... }`

4. Create a controller in your Laravel application to handle the charge request.

5. Create a route in your routes/web.php file to handle the request.

6. Create a view to display the payment form.

7. Create a Stripe webhook to receive notifications about successful payments.
