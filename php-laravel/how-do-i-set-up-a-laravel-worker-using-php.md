# How do I set up a Laravel worker using PHP?
// plain

1. First, you need to install the Laravel framework on your server. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel <project-name>`

2. Next, you need to create a worker file. This file should contain the code that will be executed by the worker. An example worker file might look like this:
```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Queue\Worker;

$worker = new Worker();
$worker->run();
```

3. Once you have created the worker file, you need to register it with the Laravel queue system. This can be done by adding the following line to your `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` file:
```php
$this->app->addWorker('worker-name', 'path/to/worker/file.php');
```

4. Finally, you can start the worker by running the following command in your terminal: `php artisan queue:work --worker=worker-name`

5. You can also add options to the command to customize the worker's behaviour, such as how many jobs to process at once and how long to wait for new jobs. For example: `php artisan queue:work --worker=worker-name --max=5 --delay=5`

6. You can find more information about setting up and running Laravel workers in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/queues).

7. You can also find more detailed information about the available queue options in the [Laravel Queue documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/queues#queue-options).
