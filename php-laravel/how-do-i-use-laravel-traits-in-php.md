# How do I use Laravel traits in PHP?
// plain

Traits are a special type of class that allow you to reuse code in multiple classes. In Laravel, traits are used to provide common functionality to multiple classes.

To use a Laravel trait, you first need to import it into the class you want to use it in. Then, you can use the `use` keyword to make the trait available within the class.

```php
class MyClass {
    use MyTrait;
}
```

Once the trait is imported, you can access any methods or properties defined in the trait within the class.

```php
class MyClass {
    use MyTrait;

    public function myMethod() {
        $this->myTraitMethod();
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `MyClass` class is using the `MyTrait` trait, and the `myMethod()` method is calling the `myTraitMethod()` method defined in the trait.

You can also override methods from traits by defining a method with the same name in the class.

```php
class MyClass {
    use MyTrait;

    public function myTraitMethod() {
        echo 'Overridden!';
    }
}

$myClass = new MyClass();
$myClass->myTraitMethod();
// Outputs: Overridden!
```

In the example above, the `myTraitMethod()` method defined in the `MyClass` class is overriding the `myTraitMethod()` method defined in the `MyTrait` trait.

For more information on using traits in Laravel, see the [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent#traits).
