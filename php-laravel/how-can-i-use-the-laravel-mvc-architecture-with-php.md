# How can I use the Laravel MVC architecture with PHP?
// plain

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. It is built on top of the PHP language and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

The MVC pattern allows developers to separate the application logic from the presentation layer and makes it easier to manage large-scale projects.

To use Laravel MVC architecture with PHP, you will need to create a Model, a View, and a Controller.

The Model is responsible for handling the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for interacting with the database and retrieving the data.

The View is responsible for displaying the data. It is usually written in HTML and CSS, and can be used to render the data from the Model.

The Controller is responsible for handling the user input. It is responsible for receiving requests from the user, processing the input, and calling the appropriate methods in the Model.

Below is a simple example of how to use the Laravel MVC architecture with PHP.

```
<?php

// Create a new controller
class MyController extends Controller
{
    // Get the data from the model
    public function getData()
    {
        $data = MyModel::getData();
        return view('myview', compact('data'));
    }
}

// Create a new model
class MyModel extends Model
{
    // Retrieve data from the database
    public static function getData()
    {
        return DB::table('mytable')->get();
    }
}

// Create a new view
<html>
    <body>
        <ul>
            @foreach($data as $row)
                <li>{{ $row->name }}</li>
            @endforeach
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

This example will display a list of names from the database table `mytable`.
