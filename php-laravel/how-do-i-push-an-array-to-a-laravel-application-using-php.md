# How do I push an array to a Laravel application using PHP?
// plain

To push an array to a Laravel application using PHP, you can use the `array_push()` function. This function will add the array elements to the end of the array.

For example,

```php
<?php
$array1 = array("a" => "apple", "b" => "banana");
$array2 = array("c" => "cat", "d" => "dog");

array_push($array1, $array2);

print_r($array1);

// Output: Array ( [a] => apple [b] => banana [0] => Array ( [c] => cat [d] => dog ) )
?>
```

In the example code above, `$array1` and `$array2` are two arrays that contain key-value pairs. The `array_push()` function is used to add the elements of `$array2` to the end of `$array1`. After the function is executed, `$array1` will contain the elements of both `$array1` and `$array2`.

The `array_push()` function takes two parameters: the array to which the elements will be added and the array containing the elements to be added. It returns the number of elements in the array after the elements have been added.

For more information, see the [PHP documentation for `array_push()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-push.php).
