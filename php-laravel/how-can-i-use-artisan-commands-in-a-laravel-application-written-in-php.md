# How can I use Artisan commands in a Laravel application written in PHP?
// plain

Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. It provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application.

To use Artisan commands in a Laravel application written in PHP, you first need to open a terminal window and cd into your application's root directory. From there, you can type `php artisan` to view a list of all available commands.

For example, if you want to create a new controller, you can type the following command:
```
php artisan make:controller MyController
```
This will create a new controller class named `MyController` in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory.

You can also use Artisan to generate database migrations, seeders, and models, as well as perform database operations like running migrations and seeding the database.

Here's an example of running database migrations with Artisan:
```
php artisan migrate
```
This will execute all of the migrations in your application's `database/migrations` directory.
