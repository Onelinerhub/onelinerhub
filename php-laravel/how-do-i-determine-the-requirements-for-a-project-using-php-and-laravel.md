// plain

In order to determine the requirements for a project using PHP and Laravel, the following steps should be taken:

1. Identify the scope of the project. This includes determining the purpose of the project, the features that it should have, and the timeline for completion.

2. Install the required software. This includes installing PHP, a web server such as Apache, and the Laravel framework.

3. Create a project structure. This includes setting up the directory structure, configuring the environment variables, and creating the database.

4. Write the code. This includes writing the application logic, creating the routes, and writing the views.

5. Test the code. This includes running unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

6. Deploy the code. This includes setting up the production environment, configuring the web server, and deploying the code.

7. Monitor and maintain the code. This includes monitoring for errors, responding to user feedback, and making sure the code is up to date.

For example, a simple "Hello World" application in Laravel might look like this:

```
<?php

Route::get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello World!';
});
```

The output of this code would be: "Hello World!"
