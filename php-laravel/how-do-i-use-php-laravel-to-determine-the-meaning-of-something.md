# How do I use PHP Laravel to determine the meaning of something?
// plain

PHP Laravel is a web application framework that can be used to determine the meaning of something. It provides a number of tools and features that can be used to create applications that can interpret the meaning of input.

For example, using the [Laravel Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent) ORM, we can create a model and use it to query a database and determine the meaning of something.

```php
<?php

use App\MeaningModel;

$meaning = MeaningModel::where('word', '=', 'example')->first();

echo $meaning->definition;

// Output:
// A thing that is typical of its kind or illustrates a general rule
```

The code above creates an instance of the `MeaningModel` and uses it to query a database for the definition of a word. The output of the code is the definition of the word "example".

In addition to Eloquent, Laravel also provides other tools and features that can be used to determine the meaning of something. For example, the [Laravel Request](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/requests) class can be used to get information from an API and use it to determine the meaning of something.
