# How can I use PHP, Laravel, and VueJS together to create a web application?
// plain

You can use PHP, Laravel, and VueJS together to create a web application by following these steps:

1. Install Laravel on your computer. This will give you access to the Laravel framework and all of its components.

2. Create the backend of the application with PHP and Laravel. This includes setting up the database, routing, and controllers.

3. Create the frontend of the application with VueJS. This includes setting up the components, views, and routes.

4. Use VueJS to make API calls to the Laravel backend. This will allow the frontend and backend to communicate with each other.

5. Use Laravel to handle the data and logic of the application. This includes creating models, migrations, and services.

6. Test the application to make sure it is working correctly.

7. Deploy the application to a hosting provider.

For example, here is a simple application that uses PHP, Laravel, and VueJS together:

```
// routes/web.php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

// resources/views/welcome.blade.php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My App</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="app">
            <example-component></example-component>
        </div>
        <script src="{{ mix('js/app.js') }}"></script>
    </body>
</html>

// resources/js/components/ExampleComponent.vue
<template>
    <div>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
</template>

<script>
    export default {
        name: 'ExampleComponent'
    }
</script>
```
