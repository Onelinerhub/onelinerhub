For example, here is a code block that uses PHP and Laravel to display a list of numbers from 1 to 10:

```
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/', function () {
    $numbers = [];

    for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
        $numbers[] = $i;
    }

    return view('index', ['numbers' => $numbers]);
});
```

This code will output a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

- `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;`: This code imports the Route class from the Illuminate package.
- `Route::get('/', function () {`: This code defines a route, which is a URL path that the application will respond to.
- `$numbers = [];`: This code creates an empty array called `$numbers`.
- `for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {`: This code creates a loop that will run 10 times.
- `$numbers[] = $i;`: This code adds the current value of `$i` to the `$numbers` array.
- `return view('index', ['numbers' => $numbers]);`: This code returns a view with the `$numbers` array.
