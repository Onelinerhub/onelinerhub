# How do I generate an app_key for my Laravel PHP application?
// plain

To generate an app_key for a Laravel PHP application, you can run the following command in the root directory of your Laravel application:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

The output of this command will look similar to the following:

```
Application key [base64:hx7kF3m/Vz8HhjFVjI8XjqBHUyj9Lq6i/y7Ljdvhjk=] set successfully.
```

This command generates an app_key and stores it in the `.env` file of your Laravel application. The app_key is used to secure user sessions and other encrypted data.

- `php`: the command to run the php interpreter
