Asking questions about Laravel using PHP can be done by using the [Laravel Forum](https://laracasts.com/discuss). The forum is a great place to ask questions and get answers from the Laravel community.

You can also use the [Laravel IRC channel](https://laravel.io/irc) to ask questions about Laravel. This is a great place to get quick answers from experienced users.

You can also use the [Laravel Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/laravel) tag to ask questions about Laravel. This is a great place to get answers from experienced developers who have worked with Laravel.

If you want to ask a more specific question about Laravel and PHP, you can use the following example code:

```
<?php

$laravel_question = "How do I use Eloquent in Laravel?";

echo $laravel_question;

?>
```

## Output example

The code above will output the question "How do I use Eloquent in Laravel?" which can then be posted to the Laravel Forum, IRC channel, or Stack Overflow.
