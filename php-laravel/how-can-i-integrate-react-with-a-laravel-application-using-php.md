# How can I integrate React with a Laravel application using PHP?
// plain

Integrating React with a Laravel application using PHP is possible with the help of the laravel-mix package. This package is a wrapper around Webpack and provides a fluent API for defining webpack build steps.

Here is an example of how to use laravel-mix to integrate React with a Laravel application:

```
// webpack.mix.js

const mix = require('laravel-mix');

mix.react('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
   .sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css');
```

This code will compile the `resources/js/app.js` file into a single `public/js/app.js` file, and compile the `resources/sass/app.scss` file into a single `public/css/app.css` file.

The following list explains the different parts of the code:
- `const mix = require('laravel-mix');` - This line imports the laravel-mix package.
- `mix.react('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')` - This line tells laravel-mix to compile the `resources/js/app.js` file into a single `public/js/app.js` file.
- `mix.sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css');` - This line tells laravel-mix to compile the `resources/sass/app.scss` file into a single `public/css/app.css` file.
