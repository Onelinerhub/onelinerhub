// plain

Setting up authentication in a Laravel application using PHP is a fairly straightforward process.

1. First, install the laravel/ui package:

```
composer require laravel/ui
```

2. Next, generate the authentication scaffolding:

```
php artisan ui:auth
```

3. Then, create the migration for the users table:

```
php artisan make:migration create_users_table
```

4. After that, run the migration:

```
php artisan migrate
```

5. Finally, add the authentication routes to the routes/web.php file:

```
Auth::routes();
```

After completing these steps, you should have a basic authentication system set up in your Laravel application.
