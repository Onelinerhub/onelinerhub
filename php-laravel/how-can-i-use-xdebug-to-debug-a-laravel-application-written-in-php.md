# How can I use Xdebug to debug a Laravel application written in PHP?
// plain

Xdebug is a powerful debugging tool for PHP applications, including Laravel applications. It allows developers to step through code line by line, inspect variables, and set breakpoints. To use Xdebug with Laravel, it must first be installed and configured.

Once Xdebug is installed and configured, you can enable debugging in your application. To do this, add the following code to your `.env` file:

```
XDEBUG_CONFIG=remote_host=localhost remote_enable=1
```

You can also enable debugging from the command line. To do this, run the following command:

```
$ php -dxdebug.remote_enable=1 artisan serve
```

Once debugging is enabled, you can begin debugging your application. To do this, open the application in your browser and set a breakpoint in your code. Xdebug will pause the application at the breakpoint and allow you to inspect variables and step through the code line by line.

Here is an example of debugging a simple Laravel application using Xdebug:

```
<?php

Route::get('/', function () {
    $name = 'John';
    $age = 25;

    // Set a breakpoint here
    echo "Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old";
});
```

When the application is run and the breakpoint is reached, Xdebug will pause the application and allow you to inspect the variables and step through the code line by line.
