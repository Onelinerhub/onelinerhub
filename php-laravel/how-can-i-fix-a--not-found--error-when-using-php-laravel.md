# How can I fix a "not found" error when using PHP Laravel?
// plain

To fix a "not found" error when using PHP Laravel, you need to check the routes file. This file is located in the `routes` directory of your project.

You can use the following command to check if the route exists:

```
php artisan route:list
```

If the route does not exist, you need to add it to the routes file. For example, if you want to add a route for the `home` page:

```
Route::get('/home', 'HomeController@index');
```

Once the route is added, you need to restart the server to apply the changes.

If the route exists, you need to check the controller and action associated with the route. Make sure that the controller and action exist and are correctly defined.

You can also check the logs for more detailed information about the error.
