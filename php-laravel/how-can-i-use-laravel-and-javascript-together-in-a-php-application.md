# How can I use Laravel and JavaScript together in a PHP application?
// plain

Laravel and JavaScript can be used together in a PHP application to create a dynamic, interactive web experience. By combining the server-side capabilities of PHP with the client-side capabilities of JavaScript, developers can create a powerful web application.

The following example shows how to use Laravel and JavaScript together:

```
// Include Laravel's Blade templating engine
@include('layouts.app')

// Create a JavaScript file
<script>
  // Add some JavaScript code
  alert('Hello World!');
</script>
```

The output of this code will be an alert box with the message "Hello World!".

## Code explanation

1. `@include('layouts.app')` - This line includes the Blade templating engine from Laravel.
2. `<script>` - This line marks the beginning of the JavaScript code.
3. `alert('Hello World!')` - This line creates an alert box with the message "Hello World!".
