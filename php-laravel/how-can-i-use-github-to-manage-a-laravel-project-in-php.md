# How can I use GitHub to manage a Laravel project in PHP?
// plain

GitHub is an ideal platform for managing a Laravel project in PHP. It provides version control, collaboration, and code review features that make it easy to keep track of changes to your project. Here's how you can use GitHub to manage a Laravel project:

1. Create a repository on GitHub for your Laravel project.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Make changes to the project files on your local machine.
4. Commit the changes to the repository.
5. Push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
6. Pull the changes from the remote repository to other collaborators' local machines.
7. Merge the changes into the main branch of the repository.

For example, to commit changes to a repository, you can use the following command:

```
git commit -m "My commit message"
```

This will commit the changes to your local repository. To push the changes to the remote repository, you can use the following command:

```
git push origin master
```

This will push the changes to the remote repository.
