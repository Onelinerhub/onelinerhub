# How can I use PHP and Laravel to create a user interface?
// plain

PHP and Laravel can be used together to create a user interface by utilizing the Laravel Blade templating engine. Blade allows for the use of PHP code within HTML templates to create dynamic user interfaces.

For example, the following code block can be used to create a simple form:

```
<form action="/submit" method="post">
    @csrf
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name">
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

This code will create a form with two input fields and a submit button. The `@csrf` directive will create a hidden input field with a security token to protect the form from malicious attacks.

## Code explanation

- `<form>`: the HTML form element
- `@csrf`: the Laravel Blade directive for adding a security token to the form
- `<input>`: HTML input elements for collecting data
- `<button>`: HTML button element for submitting the form
