// plain

PHP, Laravel, and NPM can be used together to develop a software application.

First, you need to install PHP, Laravel, and NPM on your computer. Then, you can create a new Laravel project using the following command:

```
$ laravel new projectname
```

This command will create a new Laravel project with the given name.

Once the project is created, you can install the necessary NPM packages with the following command:

```
$ npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary NPM packages for the project.

You can now start developing the software application using PHP and Laravel. You can also use NPM to manage the project's dependencies and run automated tasks.

## Code explanation

- `laravel new projectname`: Creates a new Laravel project with the given name.
