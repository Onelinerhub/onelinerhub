How can I use threading in a Laravel project written in PHP?
// plain

Threading can be used in a Laravel project written in PHP by leveraging the `pthreads` extension. `pthreads` is a PHP extension that allows developers to create multi-threaded applications. To use `pthreads` in a Laravel project, the extension must first be installed and enabled in the `php.ini` configuration file.

## Example code

```
<?php
$thread = new \Thread(function () {
    echo "Hello from a thread!";
});

$thread->start();
```
## Output example

```
Hello from a thread!
```

The code above creates a new thread and starts it. The thread will then execute the code inside the closure, which in this case is to echo "Hello from a thread!".

To monitor the status of the thread, the `isStarted()`, `isRunning()`, and `isJoined()` methods can be used. To wait for the thread to finish executing, the `join()` method can be used.
