# How do I create a project using PHP and Laravel?
// plain

Creating a project using PHP and Laravel is fairly simple. First, you need to install the Laravel framework on your machine. This can be done using the Composer dependency manager. Once you have installed Laravel, you can create a new project by using the `laravel new` command. For example, the following command will create a new project called "myproject":

```
$ laravel new myproject
```

This command will create a new directory called "myproject" containing the necessary files and directories for your project. You can then start writing your code in the `app/` directory.

In addition to the basic files, Laravel also provides a number of other features that can be used in your project. These features include routing, authentication, sessions, and more. You can find more information about these features in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).

Finally, you can start running your project by using the `php artisan serve` command. This command will start a web server on your machine that you can access in your browser.
