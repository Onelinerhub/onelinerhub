# How can I use PHP Laravel and Kafka together to develop software?
// plain

PHP Laravel and Kafka can be used together to develop software by creating a Laravel project that contains a Kafka client library. This library can be used to produce and consume messages from Kafka topics.

For example, the following code block can be used to produce a message to a Kafka topic:

```
use App\Kafka\Producer;

$producer = new Producer;
$producer->send('my-topic', 'my-message');
```

The following code block can be used to consume messages from a Kafka topic:

```
use App\Kafka\Consumer;

$consumer = new Consumer;
$messages = $consumer->consume('my-topic');

foreach ($messages as $message) {
    echo $message;
}
```

## Code explanation


- `use App\Kafka\Producer`: This statement imports the Producer class from the Kafka library.
- `$producer = new Producer`: This statement creates an instance of the Producer class.
- `$producer->send('my-topic', 'my-message')`: This statement sends a message to the `my-topic` Kafka topic.
- `use App\Kafka\Consumer`: This statement imports the Consumer class from the Kafka library.
- `$consumer = new Consumer`: This statement creates an instance of the Consumer class.
- `$messages = $consumer->consume('my-topic')`: This statement consumes messages from the `my-topic` Kafka topic.
- `foreach ($messages as $message)`: This statement iterates over the consumed messages.
