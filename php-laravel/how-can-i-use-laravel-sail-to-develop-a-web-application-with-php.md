# How can I use Laravel Sail to develop a web application with PHP?
// plain

Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel applications. It provides an easy way to develop and manage a web application with PHP.

Here is an example of how to use Laravel Sail to create a web application:

```
$ sail new myapp
```

This command will create a new Laravel application in the `myapp` directory.

Once the application is created, you can start the development server with the following command:

```
$ sail lift
```

This will start the development server and provide a URL to view the application in the browser.

You can also use Laravel Sail to manage your database. Here is an example of how to create a new database:

```
$ sail db:create
```

This command will create a new database for your application.

Finally, you can use Laravel Sail to deploy your application to a web server.

Here is an example of how to deploy an application to a server:

```
$ sail deploy production
```

This command will deploy the application to the `production` server.
