# How can I use PHP and Laravel to build a content management system?
// plain

A content management system (CMS) can be built using PHP and Laravel. Laravel is an open-source PHP framework that provides an expressive and elegant syntax for developing web applications.

To begin building a CMS, you will need to create a database to store the content. This can be done using Laravel's built-in database migrations. Once the database is set up, you can create models and controllers to manage the content.

For example, you can create a `Post` model to store posts in the database.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['title', 'content'];
}
```

You can then create a `PostController` to handle the requests related to posts.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Post;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class PostController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $posts = Post::all();

        return view('posts.index', compact('posts'));
    }
}
```

Finally, you can create views to display the content.

```html
<h1>Posts</h1>

@foreach ($posts as $post)
    <h2>{{ $post->title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ $post->content }}</p>
@endforeach
```

By combining the database migrations, models, controllers, and views, you can create a content management system using PHP and Laravel.
