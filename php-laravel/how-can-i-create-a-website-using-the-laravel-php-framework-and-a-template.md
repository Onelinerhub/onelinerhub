# How can I create a website using the Laravel PHP framework and a template?
// plain

Creating a website using the Laravel PHP framework and a template is a simple process. To begin, you'll need to install the Laravel framework on your server. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel myproject
```

Once the installation is complete, you'll need to download the template you'd like to use for your website. Once the template is downloaded, you'll need to place the template files in the `resources/views` directory of your Laravel project.

Next, you'll need to create a controller to handle the requests for the template. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```
php artisan make:controller PagesController
```

The controller will need to have a function to render the template, which can be done with the following code:

```
public function index()
{
    return view('template');
}
```

Finally, you'll need to define a route in the `routes/web.php` file to point to the controller:

```
Route::get('/', 'PagesController@index');
```

Once all of these steps have been completed, you should be able to view your website by navigating to the URL specified in the route.

**Parts of code:**
1. `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel myproject` - this command installs the Laravel framework on the server.
2. `php artisan make:controller PagesController` - this command creates a controller to handle requests for the template.
3. `return view('template');` - this code renders the template and is placed in the controller.
4. `Route::get('/', 'PagesController@index');` - this code defines a route in the `routes/web.php` file that points to the controller.
