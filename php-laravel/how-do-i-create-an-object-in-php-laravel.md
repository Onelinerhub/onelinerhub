# How do I create an object in PHP Laravel?
// plain

Creating an object in PHP Laravel is quite simple. To do this, you must first define a class for the object. For example:
```
class MyObject
{
    public $name;
    public $age;

    public function __construct($name, $age)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
    }
}
```
This class defines two public variables, `$name` and `$age`, and a constructor which sets the values of these variables.

To create an instance of this object, you can use the `new` keyword:
```
$object = new MyObject('John', 35);
```
This will create a new instance of the `MyObject` class, with `$name` set to `John` and `$age` set to `35`.

The following parts were used to create an object in PHP Laravel:

- Class definition: This is the code that defines the structure and behaviour of the object.
- `new` keyword: This is the keyword used to create an instance of the object.
- Constructor: This is a special function that is called when an object is created.

For more information about creating objects in Laravel, see the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/objects).
