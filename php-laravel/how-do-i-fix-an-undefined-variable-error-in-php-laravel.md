# How do I fix an undefined variable error in PHP Laravel?
// plain

An undefined variable error in PHP Laravel can be fixed by declaring the variable before it is used. This is done by using the `$variableName = value;` syntax. For example:

```
$name = "John";
echo "My name is $name";
```
## Output example

```
My name is John
```

In this example, the `$name` variable is declared before it is used in the `echo` statement.

Alternatively, you can use the `isset()` function to check if a variable is set before using it. For example:

```
if (isset($name)) {
    echo "My name is $name";
}
```

The `isset()` function will return `true` if the variable is set, and `false` if it is not.

You can also use the `empty()` function to check if a variable is empty or not. For example:

```
$name = "";
if (empty($name)) {
    echo "Name is empty";
}
```
## Output example

```
Name is empty
```

These are some of the ways to fix an undefined variable error in PHP Laravel.
