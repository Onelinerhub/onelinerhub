# How do I use the PHP Laravel language to develop software?
// plain

The PHP Laravel language is a popular open source web development framework that can be used to create powerful and robust software applications. It is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which makes it easier to organize and manage application logic.

To use Laravel to develop software, you will need to install the Laravel framework on your server. Once installed, you can create a new project using the command line tool `laravel new <project-name>`. This will create a new project folder with the necessary files and folders to start developing your application.

Once your project is created, you will need to configure the database connection settings in the `.env` file. After that, you can create your models, controllers, and views in the `app` folder.

For example, to create a model for a user, you can create a file `User.php` in the `app/Models` folder with the following code:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    //
}
```

To create a controller for a user, you can create a file `UserController.php` in the `app/Http/Controllers` folder with the following code:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $users = User::all();

        return view('users.index', compact('users'));
    }
}
```

Finally, to create a view for a user, you can create a file `index.blade.php` in the `resources/views/users` folder with the following code:
```php
@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
    <h1>All Users</h1>

    <ul>
        @foreach ($users as $user)
            <li>{{ $user->name }}</li>
        @endforeach
    </ul>
@endsection
```

By following these steps, you can use the PHP Laravel language to develop software.

- **Installation**: Install the Laravel framework on your server.
- **Project Creation**: Create a new project using the `laravel new` command.
- **Database Configuration**: Configure the database connection settings in the `.env` file.
