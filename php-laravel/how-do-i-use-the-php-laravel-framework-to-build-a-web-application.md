# How do I use the PHP Laravel framework to build a web application?
// plain

The Laravel PHP framework is a great choice for developing web applications. It provides an easy to use, powerful, and robust framework. Here's an example of how to create a basic web application using Laravel:

```
// Create a new Laravel project
composer create-project laravel/laravel my_project

// Go to your project directory
cd my_project

// Start the development server
php artisan serve
```

The above commands will create a new Laravel project and start a development server. You can now access your project by opening http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

The main parts of a Laravel project are:

- **Routes:** These are the endpoints of the application. They define the URL paths and the associated controller actions.
- **Controllers:** These are the classes that handle requests. They contain the logic for the application and call any necessary models and views.
- **Models:** These are the classes that represent the data of the application. They contain the database queries and the logic to manipulate the data.
- **Views:** These are the files that contain the HTML markup and the code to display the data.
