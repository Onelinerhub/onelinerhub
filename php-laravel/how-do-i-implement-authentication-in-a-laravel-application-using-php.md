# How do I implement authentication in a Laravel application using PHP?
// plain

Authentication in a Laravel application using PHP can be implemented using the built-in authentication system. To do this, we can use the `php artisan make:auth` command to create the necessary views and controllers for authentication.

For example, we can use the command `php artisan make:auth` to create the authentication views and controllers.

```
$ php artisan make:auth

Authentication scaffolding generated successfully.
```

The command will create the following files:

* `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`: Responsible for authenticating users.
* `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php`: Responsible for validating and creating new users.
* `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/ResetPasswordController.php`: Responsible for resetting passwords.
* `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/ForgotPasswordController.php`: Responsible for sending password reset emails.
* `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`: The login form.
* `resources/views/auth/register.blade.php`: The registration form.
* `resources/views/auth/passwords/email.blade.php`: The forgot password form.
* `resources/views/auth/passwords/reset.blade.php`: The reset password form.

Once these files are created, we can use the `Auth` facade to authenticate users in our application.

For more information on authentication in Laravel, see the official documentation: https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/authentication.
