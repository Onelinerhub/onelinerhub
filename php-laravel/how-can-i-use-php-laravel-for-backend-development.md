# How can I use PHP Laravel for backend development?
// plain

PHP Laravel is a powerful open-source web application framework used for backend development. It is built on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and provides a robust set of features such as routing, authentication, sessions, and caching.

## Example code

```
<?php

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

The example code above is a simple route definition that will respond to a GET request to the root URL of the application. The code will return the view located at `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`.

Laravel also provides a number of other features such as authentication, sessions, and caching. For example, to create a new session, you can use the following code:

```
<?php

Session::put('key', 'value');
```

The code above will create a new session with the key `key` and the value `value`.

Laravel also provides a powerful query builder that can be used to construct complex database queries. For example, the following code will retrieve all records from a table named `users`:

```
<?php

$users = DB::table('users')->get();
```
