# How can I set up hosting for a PHP Laravel application?
// plain

Setting up hosting for a PHP Laravel application is a fairly straightforward process. First, you need to install the necessary packages and dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```
composer install
```

Once the packages and dependencies have been installed, you can configure the web server. For example, if you are using Apache, you can add the following code to your httpd.conf file:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/public
    <Directory /var/www/html/public>
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Next, you need to configure the database. You can do this by editing the .env file and adding the necessary database credentials.

Finally, you need to configure the application. This can be done by running the following command:

```
php artisan config:cache
```

Once the configuration is complete, you can deploy the application to your web server.
