# How do I build a project with PHP and Laravel?
// plain

1. First, you need to install [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation) on your machine.

2. Once the installation is complete, you can create a new project with the command `laravel new <project-name>`.

3. Then, you can start building the project by adding the necessary files and folders.

4. After that, you can add the PHP code for the project. Here is an example of a basic "Hello World" program in Laravel:

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello World!';
});
```

## Output example
 `Hello World!`

5. Once the code is written, you can run the project using the command `php artisan serve`.

6. Finally, you can test the project by visiting the URL provided by the command.
