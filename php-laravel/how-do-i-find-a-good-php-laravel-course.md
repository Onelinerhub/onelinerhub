# How do I find a good PHP Laravel course?
// plain

The best way to find a good PHP Laravel course is to do some research. Look for reviews from other students who have taken the course, and check out the instructor's background. Also, make sure the course covers the topics you need to learn.

You can also try out some tutorials or sample code to get a better idea of how the framework works. For example, here is a simple “Hello World” program written in PHP Laravel:

```
Route::get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello World!';
});
```

## Output example
 `Hello World!`

The code above contains two parts:

1. `Route::get('/', function () {` - This part defines a route that will respond to the root URL of the application.

2. `return 'Hello World!';` - This part returns the string “Hello World!” when the route is accessed.

These are just the basics of PHP Laravel, but it should give you an idea of what the framework is capable of. There are plenty of resources online to help you learn more, including official documentation, tutorials, and online courses.
