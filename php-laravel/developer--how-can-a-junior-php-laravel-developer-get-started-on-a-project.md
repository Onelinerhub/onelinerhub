How can a junior PHP Laravel developer get started on a project?
// plain

A junior PHP Laravel developer can get started on a project by first familiarizing themselves with the Laravel framework. They should read the official documentation and tutorials to get an understanding of the concepts and the syntax.

They should then create a project folder and install Laravel using the `composer create-project` command.

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project-name
```

Once the installation is complete, they should create a database and configure the environment variables in the `.env` file.

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=project-name
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Then they should use the `php artisan` command to generate the necessary files and folders for the project.

```
php artisan make:controller ControllerName
php artisan make:model ModelName
php artisan make:migration MigrationName
```

After the files and folders are created, they should start coding the logic of the application. They should use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to structure their code.

Finally, they should test the application to make sure it works as expected.
