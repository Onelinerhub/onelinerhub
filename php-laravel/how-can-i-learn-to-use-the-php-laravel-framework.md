To learn how to use the PHP Laravel framework, here are some steps you can take:

1. Read through the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x) to get a good understanding of the framework and its features.

2. Familiarize yourself with the [MVC architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mvc_framework/mvc_framework_introduction.htm) that Laravel uses.

3. Install the [Laravel Installer](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation#installing-laravel) and create a new project.

4. Write some basic code in the project, such as:

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return 'Hello World!';
});
```

## Output example


```
Hello World!
```

5. Explore the different components of the framework such as [routing](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/routing), [controllers](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/controllers), [views](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/views), [models](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent), [migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/migrations), and [authentication](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/authentication).

6. Check out [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) for video tutorials and other helpful resources.

7. Practice building small projects using Laravel to get more comfortable with the framework.
