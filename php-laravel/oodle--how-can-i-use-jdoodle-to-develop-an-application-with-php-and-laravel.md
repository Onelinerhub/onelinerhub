// plain

JDoodle is a free online compiler and IDE for developing applications with PHP and Laravel. It provides a platform for developers to write, compile, and debug code in an intuitive browser-based environment.

To use JDoodle for developing an application with PHP and Laravel, first create a new project in JDoodle. Select PHP as the language and Laravel as the framework.

Once the project is created, you can start writing your code. For example:

```
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->hasMany('App\Post');
    }
}
```

This code creates a User model with a hasMany relationship to the Post model.

You can then compile the code by clicking the "Run" button. If the code is valid, the output will be displayed in the output window.
