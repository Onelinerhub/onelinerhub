# How do I use the Laravel roadmap to plan my PHP project?
// plain

The Laravel roadmap is a great tool for planning your PHP project. It provides a timeline of upcoming features, bug fixes, and other improvements. To use it, simply visit the roadmap page and select the version of Laravel you're using. The roadmap will then show you the planned features and bug fixes for that version.

For example, if you're using Laravel 5.8, you can view the roadmap for that version. It will show you the planned features for the next release, such as new database drivers, improved authorization support, and more.

You can also use the roadmap to plan your project. For example, if you know you'll need a new database driver in the future, you can plan for it now. You can also use it to plan for bug fixes, security updates, and other improvements that may be necessary for your project.

Here's an example of how you can use the roadmap to plan your project:

```
// Get the roadmap for Laravel 5.8
$roadmap = Laravel\Roadmap::for('5.8');

// Check for planned features
if ($roadmap->hasFeature('new database driver')) {
    // Plan for the new database driver
    // ...
}

// Check for planned bug fixes
if ($roadmap->hasBugfix('security update')) {
    // Plan for the security update
    // ...
}
```

By using the Laravel roadmap, you can easily plan for upcoming features and bug fixes, ensuring that your project is up-to-date and secure.
