# How can I get started with a PHP Laravel course?
// plain

1. To get started with a PHP Laravel course, first you need to install the Laravel framework on your computer. You can do this by using Composer, a dependency manager for PHP. To install Composer, run the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

2. Once Composer is installed, you can use it to install the Laravel framework. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-project
```

3. After the installation is complete, you can begin exploring the Laravel documentation. This will help you understand the basics of the framework and how it works.

4. You can also find many tutorials and courses online to help you learn Laravel. Some of the popular courses are available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/topic/laravel/), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/search?q=laravel) and [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/).

5. It is also important to practice coding while learning Laravel. You can use an online code editor like [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to write and test your code.

6. Once you have a good understanding of the basics of Laravel, you can start building your own applications. You can use the [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/homestead) virtual machine to set up a local development environment.

7. Finally, you can join the Laravel community to get help and advice from other developers. You can join the [Laravel Forum](https://laracasts.com/discuss) and the [Laravel Slack Channel](https://laravel.com/slack).
