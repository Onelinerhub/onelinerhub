# How do I create a secure login system using PHP and Laravel?
// plain

A secure login system using PHP and Laravel can be created by following these steps:

1. Create a `User` model with `name`, `email` and `password` fields.

2. Generate a `password_hash` for the user's password using the `bcrypt` algorithm.

```php
$password_hash = \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash::make($password);
```

3. Create a `login` route which takes the `email` and `password` as input.

4. Check the `email` against the database and fetch the corresponding `password_hash`.

5. Use the `bcrypt` algorithm to verify the `password` against the `password_hash`.

```php
if (\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash::check($password, $password_hash)) {
    // password is valid
}
```

6. If the `password` is valid, log the user in and redirect them to the homepage.

7. Implement other security measures such as rate limiting, two-factor authentication, etc.
