Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to send HTTP requests and trivial to integrate with web services.

To install Guzzle, you need to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.

Run the following command in your project directory:

```
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```

This will install the latest version of Guzzle and all required dependencies.

You can then use Guzzle in your project by including the autoloader:

```
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

You can now use Guzzle in your project. For more information, please refer to the [Guzzle documentation](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/).
