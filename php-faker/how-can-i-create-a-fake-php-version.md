# How can I create a fake PHP version?
// plain

Creating a fake PHP version is possible by creating a custom version of the PHP interpreter that can be used in place of the real version. To do this, you will need to write a program that mimics the behavior of the real version of PHP.

For example, you can create a simple PHP interpreter that prints out a fake version number when it is run:

```
<?php
echo "PHP version 7.0.1";
?>
```
## Output example

```
PHP version 7.0.1
```

The code above consists of two parts:
1. The opening PHP tag (`<?php`) which marks the beginning of the code block, and
2. The `echo` statement, which prints out the fake version number.

You can also create a more complex version of the interpreter that can interpret and execute other PHP code, such as conditionals and loops.
