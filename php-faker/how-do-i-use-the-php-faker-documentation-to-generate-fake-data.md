# How do I use the PHP Faker documentation to generate fake data?
// plain

PHP Faker is a library for generating fake data such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. To use it, you must first install it using Composer.

Once installed, you can use the PHP Faker documentation to generate fake data. For example, you can generate a fake name by using the following code:

```php
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
echo $faker->name;
```

This code will output a random name, such as "Shannon Jones".

You can also use the PHP Faker documentation to generate other types of fake data, such as fake addresses, phone numbers, emails, and more. The code for generating these types of data will vary depending on the type of data you want to generate.

## Code explanation


- `Faker\Factory::create()` – This creates a new Faker instance.
- `->name` – This generates a fake name.
- `->address` – This generates a fake address.
- `->phoneNumber` – This generates a fake phone number.
- `->email` – This generates a fake email address.
