# How do I use the PHP Faker library to generate numbers?
// plain

The PHP Faker library is a powerful tool for generating fake data in various formats. It can be used to generate random numbers for various purposes. To use the library, first install it via composer:

```
composer require fzaninotto/faker
```

Once installed, you can use the library to generate random numbers. Here is an example:

```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->numberBetween(1, 10);

```

## Output example

```
7
```

The code above will generate a random number between 1 and 10. The `numberBetween` function takes two parameters - the minimum and maximum numbers - and returns a random number within that range.

You can also use the `randomDigit` function to generate a random single digit number, or the `randomDigitNotNull` function to generate a random single digit number which is not zero.
