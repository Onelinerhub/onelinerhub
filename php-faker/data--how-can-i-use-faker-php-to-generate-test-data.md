How can I use Faker PHP to generate test data?
// plain

Faker PHP is a library which can be used to generate fake data for testing purposes. It can be used to generate fake data such as names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, and more. To use Faker PHP, you will need to install it using Composer.

## Example code

```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->name;
```

## Output example

```

```

The code above uses the `require_once` function to include the Faker PHP library. Then, the `Faker\Factory::create()` method is used to create a new Faker instance. Finally, the `name` property is called to generate a fake name.

The Faker PHP library also includes other properties which can be used to generate different types of fake data. For example, the `address` property can be used to generate a fake address, the `email` property can be used to generate a fake email address, and the `phoneNumber` property can be used to generate a fake phone number.
