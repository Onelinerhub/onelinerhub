# How can I generate a unique word using PHP Faker?
// plain

Using the PHP Faker library, you can generate a unique word with the `lexify()` method. This method takes a string of characters and randomizes them to create a unique word. The following example code will generate a unique word of 8 characters:

```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->lexify('????????');

// Output: "eKfYvTzP"
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';` - This is used to include the Faker library so it can be used in the code.

2. `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();` - This creates a new Faker instance.

3. `echo $faker->lexify('????????');` - This calls the `lexify()` method on the `$faker` instance and passes it a string of 8 question marks. The method will then randomize the characters and output a unique word.

For more information on the `lexify()` method and other methods available in the Faker library, please see the [official documentation](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#fakerlexifystring).
