# How do I install and use the PHP Faker Composer package?
// plain

1. To install the PHP Faker Composer package, open the terminal and type `composer require fzaninotto/faker`. This will install the package in your project.

2. To use the package, you need to include the autoloader in your project. This can be done by adding the following line of code in your project: `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';`

3. After including the autoloader, you can create a Faker instance and use the provided methods to generate fake data. The following code block shows an example of how to generate a fake email address:

```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->email;

```

## Output example

```
jeffery.bruen@example.org
```

4. The Faker package also provides a wide range of other methods to generate fake data, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, dates, and more.
