# How can I use Laravel Faker to create a many-to-many relationship?
// plain

To use Laravel Faker to create a many-to-many relationship, you can use the `hasMany` and `belongsToMany` relationships.

## Example code

```php
use Faker\Generator as Faker;

$factory->define(App\User::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        // ...
    ];
});

$factory->define(App\Post::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        // ...
    ];
});

$factory->define(App\Tag::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        // ...
    ];
});

// Create the many-to-many relationship
$factory->define(App\PostTag::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'post_id' => App\Post::all()->random()->id,
        'tag_id' => App\Tag::all()->random()->id,
    ];
});
```

The code above is an example of how to use Laravel Faker to create a many-to-many relationship. It defines three models: `User`, `Post` and `Tag`, and a fourth model `PostTag` to define the many-to-many relationship between `Post` and `Tag`. The `PostTag` model contains two columns, `post_id` and `tag_id`, which are populated randomly from the `Post` and `Tag` models.

## Code explanation


- `use Faker\Generator as Faker;`: This is the import statement for the Faker class.

- `$factory->define(App\User::class, function (Faker $faker) {...}`: This is the definition of the `User` model.

- `$factory->define(App\Post::class, function (Faker $faker) {...}`: This is the definition of the `Post` model.

- `$factory->define(App\Tag::class, function (Faker $faker) {...}`: This is the definition of the `Tag` model.

- `$factory->define(App\PostTag::class, function (Faker $faker) {...}`: This is the definition of the `PostTag` model, which contains two columns, `post_id` and `tag_id`, which are populated randomly from the `Post` and `Tag` models.
