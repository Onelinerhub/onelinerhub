# How do I set the locale for PHP Faker?
// plain

Setting the locale for PHP Faker requires the use of the `$faker->locale` method. This method takes a single parameter, which is the locale string. For example:

```php
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
$faker->locale('es_ES');
```

The above code sets the locale of the Faker instance to Spanish (Spain).

The locale string must be one of the supported [locales](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#localization).

The locale affects the data generated by the Faker instance. For example, in the Spanish (Spain) locale, the `$faker->name` method will generate Spanish names, while in the English (United States) locale, it will generate English names.

In addition to setting the locale via the `$faker->locale` method, it can also be set via the constructor, like so:

```php
$faker = Faker\Factory::create('es_ES');
```

The locale can also be set using environment variables. See the [documentation](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#environment-variables) for more details.

Finally, the locale can be changed at any time by calling the `$faker->locale` method.
