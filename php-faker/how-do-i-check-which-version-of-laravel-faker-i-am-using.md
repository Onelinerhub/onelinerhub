# How do I check which version of Laravel Faker I am using?
// plain

To check which version of Laravel Faker you are using, you can run the following command:
```
composer show fzaninotto/faker
```
The output of this command should look something like this:
```
fzaninotto/faker  v1.8.0  Faker is a PHP library that generates fake data for you
```
This indicates that you are using version 1.8.0 of Faker.

Alternatively, you can check the `composer.json` file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain a line like this:
```
"fzaninotto/faker": "^1.8"
```
The version number after the colon (`:`) indicates which version of Faker you are using. In this case, it's version 1.8.

You can also check the `composer.lock` file, which contains a list of all the packages installed in your project. Look for a line like this:
```
"name": "fzaninotto/faker",
"version": "1.8.0",
```
The version number after `version` indicates which version of Faker you are using.

Finally, you can check the [Faker repository on GitHub](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker). The latest version of Faker is always listed at the top of the page.

If you need more detailed information, you can refer to the [Laravel Faker documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/faker).

Hope this helps!
