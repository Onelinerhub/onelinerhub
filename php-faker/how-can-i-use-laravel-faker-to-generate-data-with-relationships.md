# How can I use Laravel Faker to generate data with relationships?
// plain

Using Laravel Faker, you can generate data with relationships by defining a model factory for each of the related models. For example, if you have a `User` and `Post` model, you can define a factory for each of them like this:

```
$factory->define(User::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'name' => $faker->name,
        'email' => $faker->unique()->safeEmail,
    ];
});

$factory->define(Post::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'title' => $faker->sentence,
        'body' => $faker->paragraph,
        'user_id' => function () {
            return factory(User::class)->create()->id;
        },
    ];
});
```

Then you can use the `make` or `create` methods to generate data with relationships:

```
$post = factory(Post::class)->make();

$post->user->name; // Generated User name
```

## Code explanation


1. `$factory->define(User::class, function (Faker $faker) { ... }` - This defines a factory for the `User` model.
2. `$factory->define(Post::class, function (Faker $faker) { ... }` - This defines a factory for the `Post` model.
3. `return factory(User::class)->create()->id` - This returns the ID of the generated `User` instance.
4. `$post = factory(Post::class)->make()` - This creates a `Post` instance with a `User` instance associated with it.
5. `$post->user->name` - This gets the name of the associated `User` instance.
