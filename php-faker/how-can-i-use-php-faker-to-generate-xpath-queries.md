# How can I use PHP Faker to generate XPath queries?
// plain

PHP Faker is a library that can be used to generate fake data for testing and development purposes. It can also be used to generate XPath queries. To do this, first you need to install Faker using composer:

```
composer require fzaninotto/faker
```

Then you can use the `Faker\Factory::create()` method to create an instance of Faker:

```
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
```

To generate an XPath query, you can use the `$faker->xpath()` method. This method takes two parameters: the node name and the node value. For example, the following code will generate an XPath query to select all `<div>` elements with a `class` attribute of `"example"`:

```
$xpath = $faker->xpath('div', 'example');
echo $xpath;
```

The output of this code will be:

```
//div[@class='example']
```

The `$faker->xpath()` method also supports multiple node values, which can be passed as an array. For example, the following code will generate an XPath query to select all `<div>` elements with a `class` attribute of either `"example"` or `"test"`:

```
$xpath = $faker->xpath('div', ['example', 'test']);
echo $xpath;
```

The output of this code will be:

```
//div[@class='example' or @class='test']
```
