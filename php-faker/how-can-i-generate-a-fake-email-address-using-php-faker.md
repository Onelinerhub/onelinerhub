// plain

Using the PHP Faker library, you can easily generate a fake email address. The following example code will generate a fake email address using the library:

```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

$email = $faker->email;

echo $email;

```

## Output example

```

```

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';` - This line loads the PHP Faker library.
2. `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();` - This line creates a new Faker instance.
3. `$email = $faker->email;` - This line generates a fake email address and stores it in the $email variable.
4. `echo $email;` - This line prints out the generated email address.
