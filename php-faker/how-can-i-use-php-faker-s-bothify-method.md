# How can I use PHP Faker's bothify method?
// plain

The [PHP Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) library provides a `bothify()` method which allows you to generate random strings with a combination of letters and numbers. This can be used for generating random passwords, usernames, or other identifiers.

#### Example

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = \Faker\Factory::create();

echo 'Random string: ' . $faker->bothify('???#####');

// Output: Random string: vHn53981
```

#### Explanation

The `bothify()` method takes a string as a parameter. The `?` and `#` characters are used as placeholders for letters and numbers respectively. The number of characters in the string determines the length of the generated string.

In the example above, `???#####` is used as the parameter. This will generate a random string with three letters and five numbers.
