# How do I use Laravel Faker?
// plain

Laravel Faker is a library that generates fake data for testing purposes. It can be used to quickly generate large amounts of data for your application.

To use Laravel Faker, first you need to install it via Composer:

```
composer require fzaninotto/faker
```

Then you can use it in your application. Here is an example of how to generate a fake name:

```
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->name;

// Output:
// Dr. Zane Koss
```

## Code explanation


- `composer require fzaninotto/faker`: This command installs the Faker library.

- `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();`: This creates a new Faker instance.

- `echo $faker->name;`: This prints out a fake name.

You can find more information about Laravel Faker on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker).
