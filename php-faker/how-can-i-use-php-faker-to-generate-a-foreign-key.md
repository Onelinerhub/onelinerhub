# How can I use PHP Faker to generate a foreign key?
// plain

PHP Faker is a library that can be used to generate fake data for testing and development purposes. It can be used to generate a foreign key by using the Faker\Provider\Uuid class. This class provides a method called uuid() which can be used to generate a UUID, which can then be used as a foreign key.

## Example code

```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

$foreign_key = $faker->uuid;

echo $foreign_key;
```

## Output example

```
3ad2b7a6-3d39-4a4d-aa7d-7e2c9b2d2db3
```

The code above uses the following components:

- `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';`: This loads the Faker library so that it can be used in the program.

- `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();`: This creates an instance of the Faker\Factory class, which is used to generate fake data.

- `$foreign_key = $faker->uuid;`: This calls the uuid() method of the Faker\Provider\Uuid class, which generates a UUID that can be used as a foreign key.

- `echo $foreign_key;`: This prints out the generated UUID.
