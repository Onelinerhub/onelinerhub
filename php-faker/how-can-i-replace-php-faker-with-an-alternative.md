# How can I replace PHP Faker with an alternative?
// plain

The best alternative to PHP Faker is FakerPHP. It is a library that provides fake data for use in testing and development. It is more powerful than PHP Faker and has more features.

For example, FakerPHP can generate a random string of characters with the following code:

```
$faker = \Faker\Factory::create();
$randomString = $faker->randomString(20);
echo $randomString;
```

## Output example

```

```

FakerPHP can also generate random numbers, dates, addresses, and more. It also has the ability to generate localized fake data for different countries.

The parts of the code above are:
- `$faker = \Faker\Factory::create();`: This creates a new FakerPHP instance.
- `$randomString = $faker->randomString(20);`: This generates a random string of 20 characters.
- `echo $randomString;`: This prints the random string.
