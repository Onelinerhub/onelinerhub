# How can I generate a book title using PHP Faker?
// plain

Generating a book title using PHP Faker can be done using the `$faker->catchPhrase` method. This method will return a random phrase that can be used as a book title.

Below is an example code block that will generate a book title using the `$faker->catchPhrase` method:

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->catchPhrase;
```

## Output example

```
Robust global attitude
```

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';` - This part includes the autoloader, which is necessary for loading the Faker library.

2. `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();` - This part creates an instance of the Faker library.

3. `echo $faker->catchPhrase;` - This part is used to generate a random phrase, which can be used as a book title.
