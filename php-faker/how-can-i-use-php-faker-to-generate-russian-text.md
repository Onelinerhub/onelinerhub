PHP Faker is a library that can be used to generate fake data for various purposes. It can be used to generate Russian text as well.

To use PHP Faker to generate Russian text, first you need to install the library. You can do so by using Composer, by running the following command in your terminal:

```
composer require fzaninotto/faker
```

Once the library is installed, you can create a new instance of the Faker class, and set the locale to Russian:

```php
$faker = Faker\Factory::create('ru_RU');
```

You can then use the various methods provided by the Faker class to generate Russian text. For example, the following code will generate a random Russian sentence:

```php
echo $faker->sentence;
```

The output of this code might be:

```
Направьте мне приглашение на поездку.
```

To generate other types of Russian text, you can use the following methods provided by the Faker class:

* `$faker->paragraph` - Generates a random Russian paragraph
* `$faker->text` - Generates random Russian text
* `$faker->name` - Generates a random Russian name
