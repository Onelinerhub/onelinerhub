# How do I use Laravel Faker to generate images?
// plain

To use Laravel Faker to generate images, you can use the `Image::make()` method. This method requires two parameters: a width and a height. Here is an example code block to demonstrate:

```
$image = Image::make(200, 200);
```

This will generate a 200x200 pixel image. You can also specify the image format and quality by passing additional parameters. For example, to generate a JPEG image with a quality of 75%, you can use the following code:

```
$image = Image::make(200, 200, 'jpg', 75);
```

The generated image can then be saved to disk or returned as a response. Here is an example of saving the image to disk:

```
$image->save('/path/to/image.jpg');
```

You can also generate an image from an existing file by using the `Image::load()` method. This method requires the path to the existing image as a parameter. Here is an example:

```
$image = Image::load('/path/to/image.jpg');
```

Once the image is loaded, you can apply various effects to it, such as resizing, cropping, and rotating.
