# How do I use Xdebug to debug a script that uses PHP Faker?
// plain

Xdebug is a PHP extension that allows for debugging of PHP scripts. To use Xdebug to debug a script that uses PHP Faker, you first need to make sure that Xdebug is installed and enabled in your PHP environment. You can then set a breakpoint in the script where you want to pause execution and inspect variables. For example, if you wanted to pause execution when a Faker instance is created, you can add the following line of code:

```
xdebug_break();
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
```

When the script is executed, execution will pause at the breakpoint. You can then inspect the variables and step through the code line by line to debug the script.

You can also configure Xdebug to log errors and warnings to a log file. This can be done by setting the xdebug.log_level and xdebug.log_file configuration options. For example:

```
xdebug.log_level=4
xdebug.log_file=/path/to/xdebug.log
```

This will log errors and warnings to the specified file.
