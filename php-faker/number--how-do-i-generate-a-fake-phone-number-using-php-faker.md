How do I generate a fake phone number using PHP Faker?
// plain

Using the PHP Faker library, it is possible to generate a fake phone number. To do this, you need to install the library by running `composer require fzaninotto/faker` in your terminal.

Once the library is installed, you can use the following example code to generate a fake phone number:

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->phoneNumber;
```

This code will output a random fake phone number such as `+1 (586) 944-7256` or `+1 (818) 783-2777`.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';` - This line is necessary to access the Faker library.

2. `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();` - This line creates a new Faker object.

3. `echo $faker->phoneNumber;` - This line uses the Faker object to generate a random phone number and prints it to the screen.

For more information about the Faker library and how to use it, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker).
