# How do I use PHP Faker to generate a query?
// plain

PHP Faker is a library that can be used to generate fake data for a variety of different applications. It is particularly useful for generating test data for database queries. To use PHP Faker to generate a query, you can use the following example code:

```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

$query = "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('".$faker->name."', '".$faker->email."');";

echo $query;
```

The output of the above code would look something like this:

```
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Sidney Wunsch', 'clyde.schultz@example.org');
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';`: This line includes the autoloader for the Faker library.
2. `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();`: This line creates an instance of the Faker library.
3. `$faker->name` and `$faker->email`: These lines use the Faker library to generate a fake name and email address.
4. `$query = "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('".$faker->name."', '".$faker->email."');"`: This line creates an SQL query which inserts the generated name and email address into the users table.
5. `echo $query;`: This line prints out the generated query.
