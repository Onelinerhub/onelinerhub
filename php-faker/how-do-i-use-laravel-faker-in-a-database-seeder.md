# How do I use Laravel Faker in a database seeder?
// plain

Using Laravel Faker in a database seeder is a great way to quickly populate a database with fake data for testing. Here is an example of how to use Faker in a database seeder:

```
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Faker\Factory as Faker;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        $faker = Faker::create();
        foreach (range(1,10) as $index) {
            DB::table('users')->insert([
                'name' => $faker->name,
                'email' => $faker->email,
                'password' => bcrypt('secret'),
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

The code above will generate 10 fake users with random name, email and password.

## Code explanation


- `use Faker\Factory as Faker`: This line imports the Faker class.
- `$faker = Faker::create()`: This line creates a new instance of the Faker class.
- `foreach (range(1,10) as $index)`: This loop will iterate 10 times.
- `DB::table('users')->insert([`: This line inserts a new row into the 'users' table.
- `'name' => $faker->name`: This line sets the 'name' column to a random name generated by Faker.
- `'email' => $faker->email`: This line sets the 'email' column to a random email generated by Faker.
- `'password' => bcrypt('secret')`: This line sets the 'password' column to a hashed version of 'secret'.
