# How can I generate a zip code using Laravel Faker?
// plain

Using [Laravel Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker), you can generate a zip code of any desired format.

Here is an example code block to generate a zip code using Faker:

```
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
$zipcode = $faker->postcode;
echo $zipcode;
```

Output of the above code:

```
93692
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();` - This creates an instance of the Faker class.
2. `$zipcode = $faker->postcode;` - This generates a zip code.
3. `echo $zipcode;` - This prints the generated zip code.
