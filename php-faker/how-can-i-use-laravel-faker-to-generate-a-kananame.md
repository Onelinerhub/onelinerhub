# How can I use Laravel Faker to generate a Kananame?
// plain

To generate a Kananame with Laravel Faker, you can use the following code:

```
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
echo $faker->kananame;
```

This will output a random Kananame, such as `山本 春子`.

The code consists of two parts:
1. `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();`: This line initializes a Faker instance.
2. `echo $faker->kananame;`: This line calls the `kananame` method, which generates a random Kananame.

For more information about using Laravel Faker, you can refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#fakerprovideren_kananame).
