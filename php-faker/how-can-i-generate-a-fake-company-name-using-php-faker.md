# How can I generate a fake company name using PHP Faker?
// plain

Using PHP Faker, you can easily generate a fake company name. The Faker library provides a number of methods to generate fake data, including company names. Here is an example of how to generate a fake company name using PHP Faker:

```
<?php
// Include the Faker library
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Create a Faker object
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

// Generate a fake company name
$companyName = $faker->company;

// Output the company name
echo $companyName;

// Output example:
// Jones-Stark
?>
```

The code above will output a fake company name such as `Jones-Stark`.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';` - This line includes the Faker library.
2. `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();` - This line creates a Faker object.
3. `$companyName = $faker->company;` - This line generates a fake company name.
4. `echo $companyName;` - This line outputs the fake company name.
