# How can I use PHP Faker to generate sample data?
// plain

PHP Faker is a library that can be used to generate fake data to populate a database or for any other testing purposes.

The following example code can be used to generate a random name using PHP Faker:
```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->name;

```
The output of the code would be a random name, such as "John Smith".

The code can be broken down into the following parts:
1. `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';` - This line is used to include the Faker library.
2. `$faker = Faker\Factory::create();` - This line creates a new instance of the Faker class.
3. `echo $faker->name;` - This line prints out a random name using the Faker instance.
