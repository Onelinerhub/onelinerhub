# How do I generate a random string using PHP Faker?
// plain

Using the PHP Faker library, you can generate random strings easily. Here is an example code block to generate a random string with 8 characters:

```
<?php
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
$randomString = $faker->randomString(8);
echo $randomString;
```

## Output example


```

```

The code consists of three parts:

1. The first part is the `$faker` variable, which is used to create an instance of the Faker library.
2. The second part is the `$randomString` variable, which is used to store the random string generated by the library.
3. The third part is the `echo` statement, which prints the random string to the screen.
