# How do I use the php artisan faker command?
// plain

The `php artisan faker` command is used to generate fake data for testing and seeding databases in Laravel applications.

For example, you can use it to create a new factory:

```
php artisan make:factory UserFactory
```

This will generate a file called `UserFactory.php` in the `database/factories` directory.

You can then use the factory to generate fake data for a user model:

```
php artisan tinker

>>> factory(App\User::class, 10)->create();
```

This will create 10 records in the `users` table.

The `php artisan faker` command is a powerful way to quickly populate your database with fake data for testing purposes.
