# How can I use PHP Faker providers to generate fake data?
// plain

PHP Faker is a library that allows you to generate fake data for testing purposes. It provides a variety of different "providers" which generate different types of fake data. To use PHP Faker providers, you first need to install the Faker library. After that, you can instantiate a Faker object and use the provided methods to generate fake data.

For example, to generate a fake name, you can use the following code:

```
<?php
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->name;
```

## Output example

```
John Smith
```

The code above instantiates a Faker object, and then calls the `name` method on it to generate a fake name.

In addition to generating fake names, Faker also provides providers for generating fake addresses, phone numbers, emails, dates, and much more. You can find a full list of the available providers [here](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#formatters).
