# How do I use Laravel Faker to generate text?
// plain

Laravel Faker is an excellent library for generating fake data. It can be used to generate fake text, such as names, addresses, and other strings.

To use Laravel Faker to generate text, you can use the following code:

```
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
$text = $faker->text;

echo $text;
```

The output of this code might look like this:

```
Est et voluptas et et voluptatem et.
```

The code above uses the `Faker\Factory::create()` method to create a new Faker instance, then the `$faker->text` method to generate a random text string.

## Code explanation


- `Faker\Factory::create()`: This method creates a new Faker instance.
- `$faker->text`: This method generates a random text string.
