How can I host a website for free using PHP?
// plain

You can host a website for free using PHP by setting up a local development environment. This can be done by downloading and installing a web server such as XAMPP, which includes both Apache and PHP.

Once XAMPP is installed, you can create a new project folder in the `htdocs` directory. To test that your local server is working, create a new `index.php` file in the project folder and add the following code:

```
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

## Output example
 `Hello, World!`

This code will print "Hello, World!" on the screen.

You can then access your website by typing `localhost` in your browser.

Parts of the code:
- `<?php` - Starts the PHP code block
- `echo "Hello, World!";` - Prints "Hello, World!" on the screen
- `?>` - Ends the PHP code block
