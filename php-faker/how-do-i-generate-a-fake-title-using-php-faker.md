# How do I generate a fake title using PHP Faker?
// plain

To generate a fake title using PHP Faker, you can use the `$faker->sentence` method. This method will generate a random sentence that can be used as a fake title.

For example, the following code block:

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();

echo $faker->sentence;

```

will output a random sentence such as:

```
Distinctively formulate impactful e-business.
```

The `$faker->sentence` method has the following parts:

- `$faker`: This is an instance of the Faker\Factory class.
- `sentence`: This is the method used to generate a random sentence.

You can find more information about the `$faker->sentence` method in the [Faker documentation](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#sentences).
