How can I use Laravel Faker to generate one element from an array?
// plain

You can use Laravel Faker to generate one element from an array by using the `randomElement` method. This method takes an array as an argument and returns a random element from the array. Here is an example:

```php
$array = [1,2,3,4,5];
$randomElement = Faker::randomElement($array);
echo $randomElement;
```

## Output example

```
3
```

The `randomElement` method takes an array as an argument and returns a random element from the array. It is important to note that the array must be in the same format as the example above, with each element being enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.

The `randomElement` method can also be used to generate a random element from a multidimensional array. Here is an example:

```php
$array = [['value1' => 'foo', 'value2' => 'bar'], ['value1' => 'baz', 'value2' => 'qux']];
$randomElement = Faker::randomElement($array);
echo $randomElement;
```

## Output example

```
['value1' => 'foo', 'value2' => 'bar']
```

In this example, `randomElement` returned a random element from the multidimensional array, which was an associative array containing two key-value pairs.
