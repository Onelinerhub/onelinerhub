# How do I create a custom provider for PHP Faker?
// plain

1. To create a custom provider for PHP Faker, first you need to create a class that extends `Faker\Provider\Base` class. This class should contain all the methods you need to generate the data you need.

2. For example, to create a provider that generates a random color:

```php
<?php

namespace Faker\Provider;

class Color extends Base
{
    public function randomColor()
    {
        return sprintf('#%06X', mt_rand(0, 0xFFFFFF));
    }
}
```

3. Then you need to register the provider. This can be done by adding a call to `addProvider()` method of `Faker\Generator` class:

```php
<?php

$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
$faker->addProvider(new Faker\Provider\Color($faker));
```

4. Now you can use the `randomColor()` method in your code:

```php
<?php

echo $faker->randomColor();
// Output: #AFCF6B
```

5. You can find more information about creating custom providers in the [official documentation](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#fakerproviderbase).

6. You can also find some useful examples of custom providers in the [official repository](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker/tree/master/src/Faker/Provider).

7. Finally, you can also find some ready-to-use custom providers on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/search/?q=faker+provider).
