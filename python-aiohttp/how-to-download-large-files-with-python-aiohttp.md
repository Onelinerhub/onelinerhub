# How to download large files with Python Aiohttp?
// plain

Python Aiohttp is a library that allows you to download large files asynchronously. It is based on the asyncio library and provides an easy-to-use API for downloading files.

## Example code

```
import aiohttp

async def download_file(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            data = await response.read()
            return data
```

## Output example

```
b'<file contents>'
```

## Code explanation

- `import aiohttp`: imports the aiohttp library
- `async def download_file(url):`: defines an asynchronous function to download a file from the given URL
- `async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:`: creates an aiohttp client session
- `async with session.get(url) as response:`: sends a GET request to the given URL
- `data = await response.read()`: reads the response data
- `return data`: returns the response data
