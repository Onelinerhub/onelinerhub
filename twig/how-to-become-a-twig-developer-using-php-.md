# How to become a Twig developer using PHP?

Becoming a Twig developer using PHP is a great way to create dynamic webpages. Twig is a templating language for PHP, and it allows developers to create powerful and dynamic webpages.

To get started, you'll need to install the Twig library. This can be done using Composer:

```
composer require "twig/twig:^2.0"
```

Once the library is installed, you can start writing Twig templates. A Twig template is a file that contains HTML, Twig tags, and Twig functions. Here is an example of a Twig template:

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{ page_title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ page_title }}</h1>
    {{ page_content }}
  </body>
</html>
```

The template above contains two Twig tags: `{{ page_title }}` and `{{ page_content }}`. These tags will be replaced with the corresponding values when the template is rendered.

To render the template, you'll need to create a PHP script. Here is an example of a PHP script that renders the template above:

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$loader = new Twig_Loader_Filesystem('templates');
$twig = new Twig_Environment($loader);

echo $twig->render('page.html', array(
    'page_title' => 'My Page',
    'page_content' => 'This is my page content.'
));
```

The script above loads the Twig library, creates a Twig environment, and renders the `page.html` template with the given values.

By following these steps, you can become a Twig developer using PHP.
