# How to use the trans filter in PHP Twig?
// plain

The `trans` filter in PHP Twig is used to translate strings into different languages. It takes a string as an argument and returns the translated version of the string.

## Example

```
{{ 'Hello World'|trans }}
```
## Output example

```
Bonjour le monde
```

The `trans` filter has two parts:

1. The string to be translated: This is the string that will be translated into the desired language.

2. The translation domain: This is an optional argument that specifies the translation domain to be used for the translation.
