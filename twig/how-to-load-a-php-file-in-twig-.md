Twig is a templating language for PHP. It is used to separate the presentation layer from the application logic. To load a PHP file in Twig, you can use the `include` tag.

```
{% include 'myfile.php' %}
```

This will include the contents of `myfile.php` in the current template.

## Code explanation


1. `{% include 'myfile.php' %}` - This is the Twig tag used to include a PHP file.
2. `myfile.php` - This is the name of the PHP file to be included.
