# How to use the OR operator in Twig and PHP?
// plain

The OR operator is used to check if one of two conditions is true. In Twig and PHP, the OR operator is represented by two vertical lines `||`.

## Example code

```
{% if variable1 == 'value1' || variable2 == 'value2' %}
    <p>One of the conditions is true.</p>
{% endif %}
```

## Output example

```
One of the conditions is true.
```

## Code explanation

- `if`: This is a control structure used to check if a condition is true.
- `variable1 == 'value1'`: This is the first condition to be checked.
- `||`: This is the OR operator.
- `variable2 == 'value2'`: This is the second condition to be checked.
- `endif`: This is used to end the control structure.
