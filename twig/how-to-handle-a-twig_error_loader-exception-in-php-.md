# How to handle a Twig_Error_Loader exception in PHP?
// plain

Twig_Error_Loader exceptions are thrown when a template cannot be found. To handle this exception, you can use a `try-catch` block to catch the exception and handle it accordingly.

```php
try {
    // code that may throw an exception
} catch (Twig_Error_Loader $e) {
    // handle the exception
}
```

## Code explanation


1. `try` - This is the start of the `try-catch` block. The code that may throw an exception is placed inside this block.
2. `catch (Twig_Error_Loader $e)` - This is the catch block. It catches the `Twig_Error_Loader` exception and stores it in the `$e` variable.
3. `// handle the exception` - This is where you can handle the exception. You can log the exception, display an error message, or take any other action you deem necessary.
