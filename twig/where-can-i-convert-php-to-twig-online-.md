You can convert PHP to Twig online using [PHP2Twig](https://www.php2twig.com/). It is a free online tool that helps you to convert your PHP code into Twig code.

For example, the following PHP code:
```
<?php
$name = 'John';
echo 'Hello ' . $name;
?>
```

Will be converted to the following Twig code:
```
{{ 'Hello ' ~ name }}
```

The `$name` variable is declared in the PHP code and is used in the Twig code. The `echo` statement is replaced with the Twig `{{ }}` syntax. The `.` operator is replaced with the Twig `~` operator.
