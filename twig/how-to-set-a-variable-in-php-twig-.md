# How to set a variable in PHP Twig?
// plain

Variables can be set in PHP Twig using the `set` tag.

```
{% set myVariable = 'Hello World' %}
```

This will set the variable `myVariable` to the string `Hello World`.

The `set` tag has the following parts:
- `{%` and `%}`: These are the Twig tags that indicate the start and end of the `set` tag.
- `set`: This is the keyword that indicates that a variable is being set.
- `myVariable`: This is the name of the variable being set.
- `=`: This is the assignment operator that assigns the value to the variable.
- `'Hello World'`: This is the value being assigned to the variable.
