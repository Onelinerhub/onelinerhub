# How do I use the Polymer JavaScript documentation to develop a software application?
// plain

The Polymer JavaScript documentation is an excellent resource for developing software applications. To use it, you'll need to understand the basics of web components and the Polymer library. Here's an example of how to create a basic web component using Polymer:

```
<dom-module id="my-element">
  <template>
    <div>Hello World!</div>
  </template>
  <script>
    Polymer({
      is: 'my-element'
    });
  </script>
</dom-module>
```

This code creates a web component called `my-element` that simply displays the text "Hello World!".

The Polymer documentation provides detailed information about the library and its features. It also includes API reference sections for each component, which provide information about the properties, methods, and events available for each component. Additionally, the documentation includes a number of tutorials and examples that demonstrate how to use the library to build applications.
