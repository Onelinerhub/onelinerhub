# How can I use a Polymer JavaScript function?
// plain

Polymer JavaScript functions are a type of reusable code that can be used to perform a variety of tasks. To use a Polymer JavaScript function, you must first declare it in the HTML file, and then call it in the JavaScript file.

An example of a Polymer JavaScript function is as follows:

```javascript
<script>
  function myFunction(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
</script>
```

This function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the sum of `a` and `b`. To call this function, you would use the following code:

```javascript
<script>
  var result = myFunction(1, 2);
  console.log(result); // 3
</script>
```

In this example, the `myFunction` function is called with parameters `1` and `2`. The result of the function is then stored in the `result` variable, and logged to the console.

The parts of the code are as follows:

- `function myFunction(a, b)` - This declares the function `myFunction`, which takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
- `return a + b` - This is the body of the `myFunction` function, which returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
- `var result = myFunction(1, 2)` - This calls the `myFunction` function, passing in the parameters `1` and `2`, and stores the result in the `result` variable.
- `console.log(result)` - This logs the value of the `result` variable to the console.
