# How can I use Polymer JavaScript to create examples?
// plain

Polymer JavaScript is a library that helps you create custom HTML elements. It's a great way to create reusable components that can be used in any web application.

To create an example with Polymer JavaScript, you'll first need to install the Polymer CLI. This will allow you to create projects with Polymer components.

Once the CLI is installed, you can create a new project with the command `polymer init`. This will generate a project structure with some basic components.

To use the components, you can create an HTML file and include the components with the `<link>` tag. For example, you could create a simple button with the following code:

```
<link rel="import" href="bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">

<dom-module id="example-button">
  <template>
    <button>Click Me!</button>
  </template>
</dom-module>
```

You can then use the button in your HTML page by adding the `<example-button>` tag.

You can also use JavaScript to add more functionality to your components. For example, you could add an onClick event to the button with the following code:

```
<script>
  Polymer({
    is: 'example-button',
    properties: {},
    onClick: function() {
      console.log('Button was clicked!');
    }
  });
</script>
```

When the button is clicked, the `onClick` function will be called and the message `Button was clicked!` will be printed to the console.

By using Polymer JavaScript, you can easily create custom HTML elements with reusable components and JavaScript functionality.

## List of Code Parts with Detailed Explanation

**Link Tag**

The `<link>` tag is used to include components from the Polymer library. It should include the `href` attribute which points to the location of the component.

**dom-module Tag**

The `<dom-module>` tag is used to create custom HTML elements. It should include an `id` attribute which is used to identify the element. Inside the `<dom-module>` tag, you can include a `<template>` tag which contains the HTML for the element.

**Polymer Function**

The `Polymer` function is used to add JavaScript functionality to custom HTML elements. It should include an `is` attribute which matches the `id` attribute of the `<dom-module>` tag. Inside the function, you can define properties and functions which can be used for the element.
