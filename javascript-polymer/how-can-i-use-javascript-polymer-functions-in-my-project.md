# How can I use JavaScript Polymer functions in my project?
// plain

Polymer functions are a great way to add interactivity and dynamic content to your project. To use them, you must first include the Polymer library in your HTML page.

Once the library is included, you can use the Polymer functions in your JavaScript code. For example, the following code creates a Polymer function to display an alert message when a button is clicked:

```
<script>
  function myAlert() {
    alert('You clicked the button!');
  }
</script>

<button onclick="myAlert()">Click Me!</button>
```

When the button is clicked, the output is:

```
You clicked the button!
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. The `<script>` tag, which defines the area where JavaScript code is written.
2. The `function myAlert()` statement, which defines the Polymer function.
3. The `alert('You clicked the button!')` statement, which displays the alert message.
4. The `<button>` tag, which defines the button element.
5. The `onclick="myAlert()"` attribute, which calls the Polymer function when the button is clicked.

For more information on using Polymer functions, see the [Polymer documentation](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview).
