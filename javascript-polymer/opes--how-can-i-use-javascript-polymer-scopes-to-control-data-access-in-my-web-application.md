How can I use JavaScript Polymer scopes to control data access in my web application?
// plain

JavaScript Polymer scopes can be used to control data access in web applications by creating a scope for each user and then restricting data access to the user's scope. For example, the following code creates a new scope for each user and restricts the user's scope to only the data that the user is allowed to access:

```
// Create a new scope for each user
var userScopes = {};

// Restrict user access to their own scope
Object.keys(userScopes).forEach(function(userId) {
  var userScope = userScopes[userId];
  userScope.restrictDataAccess(userId);
});
```

This code creates a new scope for each user and then restricts the user's scope to only the data that the user is allowed to access. The code consists of the following parts:

1. `var userScopes = {};` - This creates an empty object to store the scopes for each user.
2. `Object.keys(userScopes).forEach(function(userId) {` - This iterates over each user's scope and passes the user's ID to the function.
3. `var userScope = userScopes[userId];` - This retrieves the user's scope from the `userScopes` object.
4. `userScope.restrictDataAccess(userId);` - This restricts the user's scope to only the data that the user is allowed to access.
