# How do I use the Polymer JavaScript library to develop a web application?
// plain

Polymer is a JavaScript library that enables developers to create web applications with reusable components. To use Polymer to develop a web application, you need to include the Polymer library in your HTML document. The following example code block shows how to include the Polymer library in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```
<script src="https://polygit.org/components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
<link rel="import" href="https://polygit.org/components/polymer/polymer.html">
```

Once the Polymer library is included, you can create custom elements using the `<dom-module>` tag. The `<dom-module>` tag is used to define a custom element and its associated behaviors. The following example code block shows how to create a custom element named `<my-element>`:

```
<dom-module id="my-element">
  <template>
    <style>
      /* Your CSS styles go here */
    </style>
    <!-- Your HTML markup goes here -->
  </template>
  <script>
    // Your JavaScript code goes here
  </script>
</dom-module>
```

Once you have defined your custom element, you can use it in your HTML document like any other HTML element. The following example code block shows how to use the `<my-element>` custom element:

```
<my-element></my-element>
```

You can also use Polymer's data binding features to bind data between your custom elements and the rest of your HTML document. This allows you to create dynamic, reactive applications.

For more information about using Polymer to develop web applications, see the [Polymer documentation](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/overview.html).
