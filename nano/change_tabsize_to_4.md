# How to set tabsize to 4 characters (instead of 8)

```bash
echo "set tabsize 4" >> ~/.nanorc
```

- tabsize 4 - will set tabsize to 4 characters (you can play with other numbers)
- ~/.nanorc - this is a nano settings file (check if you already have this file, you might need to manually edit ```tabsize``` param)
