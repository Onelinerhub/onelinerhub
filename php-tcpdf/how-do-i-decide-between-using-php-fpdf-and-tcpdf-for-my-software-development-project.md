When deciding between using PHP FPDF and TCPDF for your software development project, there are several things to consider.

First, consider the features of each library. FPDF is a pure PHP library that allows you to create PDF documents without using the PDFlib library. It has basic features for creating documents such as headers, footers, page breaks, etc. TCPDF is a more advanced library with more features such as support for UTF-8, barcodes, TrueTypeUnicode, and other advanced features.

Second, consider the performance of each library. FPDF is a lightweight library and is generally faster than TCPDF. However, TCPDF is more feature-rich and can handle complex documents more efficiently.

Third, consider the cost of each library. FPDF is free and open source, while TCPDF requires a license.

Finally, consider the documentation and support for each library. FPDF has limited documentation and no official support. TCPDF has more comprehensive documentation and support.

For example, here is a simple example of creating a PDF file with FPDF:

```
<?php
require('fpdf.php');

$pdf = new FPDF();
$pdf->AddPage();
$pdf->SetFont('Arial','B',16);
$pdf->Cell(40,10,'Hello World!');
$pdf->Output('hello_world.pdf','F');
?>
```

This code will create a PDF file called "hello_world.pdf" containing the text "Hello World!".

In conclusion, when deciding between using PHP FPDF and TCPDF for your software development project, consider the features, performance, cost, and documentation/support of each library.
