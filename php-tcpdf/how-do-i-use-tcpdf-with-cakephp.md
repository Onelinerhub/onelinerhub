# How do I use TCPDF with CakePHP?
// plain

Using TCPDF with CakePHP is relatively easy. Here is an example code block that will generate a PDF file and output the contents of that file:
```
$pdf = new \TCPDF();
$pdf->AddPage();
$pdf->Write(0, 'Hello World');
$pdf->Output('hello_world.pdf', 'I');
```
The code above will generate a PDF file containing the text 'Hello World'.

The code is broken down into four parts:
1. `$pdf = new \TCPDF();` - This creates a new TCPDF instance.
2. `$pdf->AddPage();` - This adds a new page to the PDF instance.
3. `$pdf->Write(0, 'Hello World');` - This adds the text 'Hello World' to the PDF instance.
4. `$pdf->Output('hello_world.pdf', 'I');` - This outputs the PDF instance to a file called 'hello_world.pdf' and opens it in the browser.
