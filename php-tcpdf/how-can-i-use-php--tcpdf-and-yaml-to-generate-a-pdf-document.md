# How can I use PHP, TCPDF and YAML to generate a PDF document?
// plain

Using PHP, TCPDF and YAML to generate a PDF document is a relatively simple process.

First, you need to include the TCPDF library in your project.

```php
require_once('tcpdf.php');
```

Once the library is included, you can create a new instance of the TCPDF class.

```php
$pdf = new TCPDF();
```

You can then use the YAML library to parse the YAML file into a PHP array.

```php
$data = yaml_parse_file('data.yaml');
```

You can then use the data from the array to generate PDF content.

```php
$pdf->AddPage();
$pdf->WriteHTML($data['content']);
```

Finally, you can output the PDF to the browser.

```php
$pdf->Output('document.pdf', 'I');
```

Parts of the Code:

1. `require_once('tcpdf.php');` - This line includes the TCPDF library.
2. `$pdf = new TCPDF();` - This line creates a new instance of the TCPDF class.
3. `$data = yaml_parse_file('data.yaml');` - This line parses the YAML file into a PHP array.
4. `$pdf->AddPage();` - This line adds a new page to the PDF document.
5. `$pdf->WriteHTML($data['content']);` - This line writes the content from the YAML array to the PDF document.
6. `$pdf->Output('document.pdf', 'I');` - This line outputs the PDF document to the browser.
