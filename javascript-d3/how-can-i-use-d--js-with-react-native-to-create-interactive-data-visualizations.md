# How can I use d3.js with React Native to create interactive data visualizations?
// plain

D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations. It can be used in React Native to create data visualizations that are both interactive and engaging. Here is an example of how to use D3.js with React Native:

```
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import * as d3 from 'd3';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const svgRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    const svg = d3.select(svgRef.current);
    // code to create visualization
  }, []);

  return (
    <svg width="300" height="300" ref={svgRef}>
    </svg>
  );
}
```

This code creates a React component that renders an SVG element and uses the `useEffect` hook to call D3.js functions to create the data visualization. The `useRef` hook is used to get a reference to the SVG element, so that D3.js can manipulate it.

## Code explanation

1. `import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';` - imports the React and React Hooks libraries.
2. `import * as d3 from 'd3';` - imports the D3.js library.
3. `const svgRef = useRef();` - creates a reference to the SVG element.
4. `const svg = d3.select(svgRef.current);` - uses the reference to select the SVG element.
5. `<svg width="300" height="300" ref={svgRef}>` - renders an SVG element and assigns the reference to it.
6. `useEffect(() => { ... }, []);` - uses the `useEffect` hook to call D3.js functions.
