# How do I use d3.js to zoom to a selected area?
// plain

Using d3.js, you can create a zoomable area by using the `zoom` behavior. This behavior allows you to specify the scale and translate of an SVG element.

For example, to zoom to a selected area, you can use the following code:
```
let zoom = d3.zoom()
  .scaleExtent([1, 8])
  .translateExtent([[0, 0], [width, height]])
  .on("zoom", zoomed);

svg.call(zoom);

function zoomed() {
  svg.attr("transform", d3.event.transform);
}
```

This code sets the `scaleExtent` to a range of 1-8, and the `translateExtent` to the width and height of the SVG element. The `zoomed` function is then called when the `zoom` behavior is triggered, and it sets the `transform` attribute of the SVG element with the `d3.event.transform` value.

## Code explanation

- `zoom`: This is the `zoom` behavior that is applied to the SVG element.
- `scaleExtent`: This is used to set the minimum and maximum zoom level.
- `translateExtent`: This is used to set the boundaries of the zoomable area.
- `on`: This is used to specify the event that triggers the zoom behavior.
- `zoomed`: This is the function that is called when the `zoom` behavior is triggered.
- `svg.call`: This is used to apply the `zoom` behavior to the SVG element.
- `svg.attr`: This is used to set the `transform` attribute of the SVG element.
