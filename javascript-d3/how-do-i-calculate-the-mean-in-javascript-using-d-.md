# How do I calculate the mean in JavaScript using D3?
// plain

To calculate the mean in JavaScript using D3, you can use the `d3.mean()` function. This function takes an array of numbers as an input and returns the mean of those numbers. Below is an example of how to use this function:

```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let mean = d3.mean(numbers);
console.log(mean);

// Output: 3
```

The code above consists of the following parts:
1. An array of numbers called `numbers` is declared.
2. The `d3.mean()` function is called and passed the `numbers` array as an argument.
3. The mean of the numbers is stored in the `mean` variable.
4. The result is logged to the console.

For more information about `d3.mean()`, please see the [D3 API Reference](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#mean).
