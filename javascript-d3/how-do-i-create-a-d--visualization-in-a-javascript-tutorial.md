# How do I create a d3 visualization in a JavaScript tutorial?
// plain

Creating a d3 visualization in a JavaScript tutorial involves a few steps. First, you'll need to include the d3 library in your HTML document by adding a script tag to the head section of the page.

```
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
```

Next, you'll need to create a selection of the DOM element you'd like to visualize. This can be done using the select() method.

```
var body = d3.select("body");
```

After that, you can use the data() method to bind data to the selection.

```
var dataset = [1,2,3,4,5];
body.selectAll("p")
    .data(dataset)
    .enter()
    .append("p")
    .text("Hello World!");
```

Finally, you'll need to use the enter() and append() methods to add elements to the DOM. You can also use the text() method to add text to the selected elements.

Parts of Code:
- `<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>`: This is the script tag used to include the d3 library in the HTML document.
- `var body = d3.select("body");`: This is the line of code used to create a selection of the DOM element you'd like to visualize.
- `var dataset = [1,2,3,4,5];`: This is the line of code used to bind data to the selection.
- `body.selectAll("p")`: This is the line of code used to select all elements of type "p".
- `.data(dataset)`: This is the line of code used to bind data to the selection.
- `.enter()`: This is the line of code used to add elements to the DOM.
- `.append("p")`: This is the line of code used to append elements of type "p" to the DOM.
- `.text("Hello World!")`: This is the line of code used to add text to the selected elements.
