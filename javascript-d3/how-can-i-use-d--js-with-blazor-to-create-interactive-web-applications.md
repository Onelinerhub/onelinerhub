# How can I use d3.js with Blazor to create interactive web applications?
// plain

D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations. It can be used with Blazor to create interactive web applications. Here's an example of how to use D3.js with Blazor:

```
@page "/"

<div id="chart"></div>

@code {
    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync()
    {
        await base.OnAfterRenderAsync();

        // Create the chart
        var chart = new Chart(
            new ChartOptions
            {
                ChartType = ChartType.Bar,
                Data = new ChartData
                {
                    Labels = new[] { "A", "B", "C" },
                    Datasets = new List<ChartDataset>
                    {
                        new ChartDataset
                        {
                            Label = "My Dataset",
                            Data = new[] { 1, 2, 3 }
                        }
                    }
                }
            });

        // Render the chart
        await chart.RenderAsync("chart");
    }
}
```

This code will create a bar chart with labels "A", "B", and "C", and data points 1, 2, and 3.

The parts of the code are:
1. The @page tag, which tells Blazor which page to render.
2. The <div> element with id "chart", which will contain the chart.
3. The OnAfterRenderAsync() method, which is called when the page is rendered and contains the code to create and render the chart.
4. The ChartOptions object, which contains the chart type and data.
5. The ChartData object, which contains the labels and datasets for the chart.
6. The ChartDataset object, which contains the label and data for the dataset.
7. The chart.RenderAsync() method, which renders the chart on the page.
