# How can I create a demo using d3.js?
// plain

Creating a demo using d3.js is a great way to learn and explore the library. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Include the d3.js library in your HTML page. This can be done by adding the following code to the head of your HTML page:
```<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>```

2. Create a container for your visualization. This can be done with a <div> element. For example:
```<div id="demo"></div>```

3. Write the code for your visualization. This will involve selecting the container element, setting up the data, and using d3.js functions to draw the visualization. For example:
```
var container = d3.select("#demo");
var data = [1,2,3,4,5];

container.selectAll("div")
  .data(data)
  .enter()
  .append("div")
  .style("width", function(d) { return d * 10 + "px"; })
  .text(function(d) { return d; });
```

The output of this code will be five divs with widths of 10px, 20px, 30px, 40px, and 50px respectively.

4. Add styling to your visualization. This can be done with CSS. For example:
```
div {
    background-color: #ccc;
    margin: 5px;
}
```

5. Test your visualization. This can be done by opening the HTML page in a browser and seeing if it works as expected.

6. Publish your visualization. This can be done by hosting the HTML page online and sharing the link with others.

7. Share your work. This can be done by posting the link to your visualization on social media or other websites.

These are the basic steps for creating a demo using d3.js. For more information, see the [d3.js documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki) and the [d3.js examples](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery).
