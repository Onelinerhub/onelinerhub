How to use d3.js with React?
// plain

React and d3.js can be used together to create interactive data visualizations. d3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data, and React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

To use d3.js with React, you can use a library like [React-d3-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-d3-library) or [React-d3-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-d3-components) which provide React components for common charts.

For example, the following code uses the React-d3-library to render a Bar Chart:

```javascript
import { BarChart } from 'react-d3-library';

const data = [
  {
    label: 'A',
    value: 5
  },
  {
    label: 'B',
    value: 10
  },
  {
    label: 'C',
    value: 15
  }
];

<BarChart
  data={data}
  width={400}
  height={400}
  margin={{ top: 10, bottom: 50, left: 50, right: 10 }}
/>
```

This code will render a Bar Chart like this:

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Import the BarChart component from the react-d3-library package.
2. Create an array of data objects that will be used to generate the chart.
3. Render the BarChart component with the data and width, height and margin props.
