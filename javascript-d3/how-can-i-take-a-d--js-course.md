1. Taking a d3.js course is a great way to learn the fundamentals of the JavaScript library. There are a variety of online courses available for different levels of experience.
2. For example, the [D3.js in Depth](https://www.udemy.com/course/d3-js-in-depth/) course on Udemy is a great resource for beginners. It covers the basics of D3.js, from the core concepts to the syntax.
3. Another option is the [D3.js Tutorials](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/d3js/) from Tutorials Point. This course is more comprehensive and covers topics such as data binding, scales, and layouts.
4. For more advanced users, the [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html) book is a great resource. It provides a comprehensive overview of D3.js and how to use it to create interactive visualizations.
5. Additionally, there are a number of tutorials and examples available online. [D3.js Tutorials](https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents) from Dashing D3.js is a great resource for learning the library.
6. Finally, there are a number of online communities and forums dedicated to D3.js. The [D3.js Slack](https://d3-slack.herokuapp.com/) is a great place to ask questions and get help from experienced developers.
7. Here is an example of a simple bar chart in D3.js:

```
var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];

var x = d3.scale.linear()
    .domain([0, d3.max(data)])
    .range([0, 420]);

d3.select(".chart")
  .selectAll("div")
    .data(data)
  .enter().append("div")
    .style("width", function(d) { return x(d) + "px"; })
    .text(function(d) { return d; });
```

The output of this code is a bar chart with the data values as the width of each bar.
