# How can I create a time scale on the x-axis using d3.js?
// plain

Creating a time scale on the x-axis using d3.js is easy.

First, you need to define the scale with the d3.scaleTime() function. This takes two parameters: the domain (the range of values to be plotted) and the range (the range of values to be plotted on the x-axis).

For example:
```
var x = d3.scaleTime()
    .domain([new Date(2018, 0, 1), new Date(2018, 11, 31)])
    .range([0, width]);
```

You can then use the scale to plot data points on the x-axis. For example, to plot a point at the beginning of the year:
```
var start = x(new Date(2018, 0, 1));
```

The output of this example code is the value of the starting point on the x-axis.

Parts of the code:
- d3.scaleTime(): This is the function used to create the time scale.
- domain(): This defines the range of values to be plotted.
- range(): This defines the range of values to be plotted on the x-axis.
- x(): This is the scale variable used to plot data points on the x-axis.
