# How do I use JavaScript and D3 to rotate elements on a webpage?
// plain

To rotate elements on a webpage using JavaScript and D3, you can use the [`d3.transition()`](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition) function. This function takes an element and applies a transformation to it. The transformation can be a rotation, scaling, or translation.

For example, to rotate an element by 45 degrees, you can use the following code:

```javascript
d3.select('#element')
  .transition()
  .duration(1000)
  .attr('transform', 'rotate(45)')
```

This code snippet will rotate the element with the ID `#element` by 45 degrees over the course of one second (1000 milliseconds).

The code consists of the following parts:

* `d3.select('#element')` selects the element with the ID `#element`
* `.transition()` creates a transition on the selected element
* `.duration(1000)` sets the transition duration to one second
* `.attr('transform', 'rotate(45)')` applies the transformation to the selected element, in this case a rotation of 45 degrees

For more information on using D3 to rotate elements, see the [D3 documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition#transition_attr).
