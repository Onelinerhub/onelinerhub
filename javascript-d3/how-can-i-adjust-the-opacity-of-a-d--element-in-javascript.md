# How can I adjust the opacity of a D3 element in JavaScript?
// plain

To adjust the opacity of a D3 element in JavaScript, you can use the `style()` method. This method takes a CSS property as an argument and allows you to set the value of that property. In this case, the CSS property is `opacity` and the value should be a number between 0 and 1.

For example:

```javascript
d3.select("#element").style("opacity", 0.5);
```

This will set the opacity of the element with the ID `element` to 0.5.

## Code explanation


* `d3.select()` - selects an element from the DOM using a CSS selector
* `style()` - sets the value of a CSS property on the selected element
* `opacity` - the CSS property to set the opacity of the element
* `0.5` - the value to set the opacity to
