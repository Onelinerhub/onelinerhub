# How can I use d3.js with Python for software development?
// plain

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. It is widely used for creating interactive visualizations on the web. It can also be used with Python for software development.

To use D3.js with Python, you can use the `d3py` library. `d3py` is a Python library designed to make working with D3.js easier. It provides a simple interface for creating D3.js visualizations from Python objects.

For example, the following code creates a simple scatter plot using `d3py`:

```python
import d3py
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame with sample data
data = {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [2, 4, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a figure with a scatter plot
fig = d3py.PandasFigure(df, 'x', 'y')
fig.show()
```

This code will create a scatter plot of the data in the `df` DataFrame.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Import the `d3py` and `pandas` libraries.
2. Create a DataFrame with sample data.
3. Create a figure with a scatter plot using the `PandasFigure` method.
4. Show the figure.
