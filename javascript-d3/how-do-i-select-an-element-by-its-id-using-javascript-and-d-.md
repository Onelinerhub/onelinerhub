# How do I select an element by its ID using JavaScript and D3?
// plain

To select an element by its ID using JavaScript and D3, you need to use the `select()` method. This method accepts a string argument which is the ID of the element you want to select. For example, the following code will select the element with ID `example-id`:

```javascript
d3.select('#example-id');
```

The `select()` method returns a selection object which contains the selected element. You can then use this selection object to perform other operations on the element, such as setting attributes or styles.

Here is an example of setting the background color of an element with ID `example-id` to `red`:

```javascript
d3.select('#example-id')
  .style('background-color', 'red');
```

## Code explanation


- `d3.select('#example-id')`: This is used to select the element with ID `example-id`.
- `.style('background-color', 'red')`: This is used to set the style of the selected element to `background-color: red;`.
