# How can I use the d3.js library to create a canvas?
// plain

Using the d3.js library, you can create a canvas by using the `<canvas>` element and the `d3.select("canvas")` method.

## Example code

```
<div>
  <canvas></canvas>
</div>
<script>
  var canvas = d3.select("canvas");
  // canvas setup code
</script>
```

The `<div>` element is used to contain the canvas. The `<canvas>` element is used to create the canvas. The `d3.select("canvas")` method is used to select the canvas and assign it to the `canvas` variable.

The `// canvas setup code` part is where you can set up the canvas. This could include setting the width and height of the canvas, adding a background color, and more.
