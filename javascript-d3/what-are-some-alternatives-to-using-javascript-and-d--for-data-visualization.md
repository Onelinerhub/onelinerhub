1. Python and Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a Python library used for data visualization. It provides a wide range of plotting functions, from simple line plots to complex 3D plots. Here is an example of a simple line plot created with Matplotlib:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

2. R and ggplot2: ggplot2 is a library for the R programming language used for data visualization. It provides a wide range of plotting functions and is especially useful for plotting statistical data. Here is an example of a simple bar chart created with ggplot2:

```
library(ggplot2)

x <- c("A","B","C","D")
y <- c(1,2,3,4)

ggplot(data.frame(x, y), aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")
```
