# How can I use a book to learn about D3.js?
// plain

1. To learn about D3.js, one of the most comprehensive resources is the book "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray.
2. This book provides a detailed overview of D3.js, starting from the basics and then moving into more complex topics.
3. It covers topics such as creating basic charts, manipulating data, working with SVG, and creating interactive visualizations.
4. It also provides example code and output for each topic, which can be used as a reference when writing your own code.
5. The book also provides a list of the different parts of the D3.js library and explains how they work.
6. Additionally, there are relevant links provided throughout the book that can be used to find additional resources.
7. For example, here is a code block from the book that creates a basic bar chart:

```
var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];

var x = d3.scale.linear()
    .domain([0, d3.max(data)])
    .range([0, 420]);

d3.select(".chart")
  .selectAll("div")
    .data(data)
  .enter().append("div")
    .style("width", function(d) { return x(d) + "px"; })
    .text(function(d) { return d; });
```
