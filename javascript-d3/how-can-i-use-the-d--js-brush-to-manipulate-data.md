# How can I use the d3.js brush to manipulate data?
// plain

The d3.js brush is a powerful tool that can be used to manipulate data. It allows users to select a range of values from a given dataset.

For example, to create a brush that selects values between 0 and 10, you can use the following code:

```
var brush = d3.brushX()
    .extent([[0, 0], [10, 10]])
    .on("brush end", brushed);

function brushed() {
    var selection = d3.event.selection;
    // selection is the range of values selected by the brush
    // use selection to manipulate data
}
```

This code creates a brush that can select values between 0 and 10. The `brushed` function is called whenever the brush is used, and the `selection` variable contains the range of values selected. This selection can then be used to manipulate data.

The following list contains the parts of the code and their functions:
* `var brush = d3.brushX()` creates a brush object
* `.extent([[0, 0], [10, 10]])` sets the range of values the brush can select
* `.on("brush end", brushed)` calls the `brushed` function whenever the brush is used
* `function brushed()` contains the code that will be executed whenever the brush is used
* `var selection = d3.event.selection` stores the range of values the brush has selected
