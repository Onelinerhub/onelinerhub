How do I implement versioning with d3.js?
// plain

Versioning with d3.js can be implemented by using the `d3.version` method. This method returns a string representing the current version of the d3 library. For example, the following code block will return `v5.15.1`:

```
d3.version
```

## Output example
 `v5.15.1`

The `d3.version` method is useful for ensuring the version of the library you are using is compatible with other code you are running. It also allows you to easily upgrade to the latest version of d3.js when necessary.

The `d3.version` method consists of the following parts:

- `d3`: This is the main object of the d3 library.
- `version`: This is the method used to retrieve the version string.
