# How can I use D3, JavaScript, and Python together to create a software application?
// plain

You can use D3, JavaScript, and Python together to create a software application by leveraging the strengths of each language. For example, you can use D3 to create interactive visualizations, JavaScript to create the user interface, and Python to access data sources and perform calculations.

```
// Example code
import d3 from 'd3';

const dataset = d3.csv('data.csv');

let data = {};

dataset.then(function(data) {
  // Perform calculations using Python
})
```

The code above imports the D3 library, loads the data from a CSV file, and then performs calculations using Python.

The parts of the code are as follows:
1. `import d3 from 'd3'`: This imports the D3 library.
2. `const dataset = d3.csv('data.csv')`: This loads the data from a CSV file.
3. `let data = {}`: This creates an empty object to store the data.
4. `dataset.then(function(data) { ... })`: This is a callback function that is called when the data is loaded. It performs calculations using Python.
