# How can I fix the "d3 is not defined" error when using JavaScript?
// plain

The "d3 is not defined" error occurs when the d3 library is not properly included in the code. To fix this, you should include the d3 library in the HTML code.

## Example code

```
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```

This code should be placed in the <head> section of the HTML file. This code will allow the d3 library to be used in the JavaScript code.

The parts of the code are:
- `<script>` : This indicates that the code is JavaScript code.
- `src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"` : This is the link to the d3 library.
- `</script>` : This indicates the end of the JavaScript code.

Once the code is added, the "d3 is not defined" error should no longer occur.
