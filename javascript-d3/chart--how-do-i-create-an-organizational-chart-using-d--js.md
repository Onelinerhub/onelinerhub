How do I create an organizational chart using D3.js?
// plain

Creating an organizational chart using D3.js is fairly straightforward. First, you need to include the D3.js library in your HTML page. Then, you need to create a hierarchical data structure that contains the nodes and links of the chart. You can do this using JSON or CSV. Finally, you need to use the D3.js library to create the chart.

## Example code

```
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
<script>

// Hierarchical data structure
const data = {
  "name": "Root",
  "children": [
    { "name": "Child 1" },
    { "name": "Child 2" },
    {
      "name": "Parent 1",
      "children": [
        { "name": "Child 3" },
        { "name": "Child 4" }
      ]
    }
  ]
};

// Create chart
const chart = d3.select("#chart")
  .append("svg")
  .attr("width", 500)
  .attr("height", 500);

// ...

</script>
```

The code above includes the D3.js library, creates the hierarchical data structure, and creates the chart. From here, you need to define the nodes and links of the chart. You can do this by appending elements to the chart, setting their attributes, and adding transitions and animations.

## Code explanation

1. Include the D3.js library in your HTML page: This is done by adding the following line to your HTML page: `<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>`
2. Create a hierarchical data structure: This is done by creating a JSON or CSV object that contains the nodes and links of the chart.
3. Create the chart: This is done by appending an SVG element to the HTML page and setting its width and height.
4. Define the nodes and links of the chart: This is done by appending elements to the chart, setting their attributes, and adding transitions and animations.
