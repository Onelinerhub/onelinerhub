# How do I quickly get started with d3.js?
// plain

Getting started with d3.js is a relatively straightforward process. Here are the steps:

1. Include the d3.js library in your HTML file.
```
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```

2. Create a selection of the elements you want to manipulate.
```
const selection = d3.select('body')
```

3. Use d3 methods to manipulate the selection.
```
selection.style('background-color', 'lightblue')
```

4. Create a data set to bind to the DOM.
```
const data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

5. Bind the data to the selection.
```
const selectionWithData = selection.selectAll('p').data(data)
```

6. Manipulate the selection with data.
```
selectionWithData.text(d => d)
```

7. Enter the elements into the DOM.
```
selectionWithData.enter().append('p').text(d => d)
```

## Output example

<body style="background-color: lightblue;">
  <p>1</p>
  <p>2</p>
  <p>3</p>
  <p>4</p>
</body>
