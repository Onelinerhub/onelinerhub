# How can I use keyboard events with d3.js?
// plain

Using keyboard events with d3.js is fairly straightforward. The basic syntax is as follows:

```
d3.select("body")
  .on("keydown", function() {
    // Do something
  });
```

This code will listen for any keydown events on the body element, and execute the code within the anonymous function when the event is detected.

For example, if you wanted to detect the 'a' key being pressed, you could modify the code as follows:

```
d3.select("body")
  .on("keydown", function() {
    if (d3.event.keyCode == 65) {
      console.log("'a' key was pressed");
    }
  });
```

This code will detect when the 'a' key is pressed and log a message to the console.

The keyCode property of the d3.event object contains the key code of the key pressed. The full list of key codes can be found here: https://keycode.info/.

In addition, you can also listen for other keyboard events such as keyup, keypress, and keydown.
