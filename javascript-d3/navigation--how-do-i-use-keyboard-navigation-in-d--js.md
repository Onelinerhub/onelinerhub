How do I use keyboard navigation in d3.js?
// plain

The d3.js library provides a number of keyboard navigation methods for DOM elements. These methods allow users to move focus around the page using the arrow keys, tab keys, and other keyboard shortcuts.

For example, the `d3.selectAll()` method can be used to select multiple elements on the page and then the `.on("keydown")` method can be used to bind a function to the keydown event. This function can then be used to move focus around the page using the arrow keys.

```javascript
d3.selectAll("div")
  .on("keydown", function() {
    if (d3.event.keyCode == 37) {  // left arrow
      // Move focus to the previous element
    } else if (d3.event.keyCode == 39) {  // right arrow
      // Move focus to the next element
    }
});
```

The `d3.event.keyCode` property can be used to get the key code of the key pressed. The above example listens for the left and right arrow keys and then moves focus to the previous or next element, respectively.

The d3.js library also provides the `d3.selection.move()` method which can be used to move focus to the next or previous element in the selection. The `.move()` method takes a string argument which can be used to specify the direction of the move. For example, `.move("next")` will move focus to the next element in the selection.

Finally, the `d3.selection.focus()` method can be used to set the focus to a specific element. This method takes a DOM element as an argument and sets the focus to that element.

```javascript
d3.select("#myElement").focus();
```

These are just a few of the keyboard navigation methods available in d3.js. For more information, please refer to the [d3.js documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#keyboard-navigation).
