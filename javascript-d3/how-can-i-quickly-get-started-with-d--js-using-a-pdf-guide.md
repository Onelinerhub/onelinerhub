# How can I quickly get started with d3.js using a PDF guide?
// plain

1. Download a PDF guide such as [this one](https://www.dashingd3js.com/d3js-first-steps) which is a great introduction to d3.js.

2. Read through the guide and follow the instructions. It will walk you through the basics of d3.js.

3. Try out the example code provided. For example, this code block will draw a circle on the page using d3.js:

```
// Select the body element
var body = d3.select("body");

// Append a circle
body.append("circle")
    .attr("cx", 50)
    .attr("cy", 50)
    .attr("r", 25);
```

4. After running the code, you should see a circle appear on the page.

5. Experiment with different values for the attributes of the circle, such as `cx`, `cy`, and `r`, to see how it affects the appearance of the circle.

6. Once you feel comfortable with the basics, you can move onto more advanced topics such as data visualization, animation, and interaction.
