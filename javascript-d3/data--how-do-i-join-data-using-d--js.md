How do I join data using d3.js?
// plain

You can join data in D3.js using the join() method. This method takes two parameters, the data array and a selector function, and it returns a selection of elements that are associated with the data array.

## Example code

```
var data = [1,2,3,4,5];

d3.selectAll("p")
  .data(data)
  .join(
    enter => enter.append("p").text("New item"),
    update => update.text("Updated item"),
    exit => exit.remove()
  );
```

The join() method takes three parameters: enter, update, and exit. The enter parameter is a function that is called for each data element in the array that does not have a corresponding DOM element. The update parameter is called for each data element in the array that has a corresponding DOM element. Finally, the exit parameter is called for each DOM element that does not have a corresponding data element in the array.

In the example code, when the join() method is called, it will loop through the data array and for each element it will check if there is a corresponding DOM element. If there is, it will call the update parameter and update the DOM element. If there isn't, it will call the enter parameter and create a new DOM element. Finally, it will call the exit parameter for any DOM element that does not have a corresponding data element.
