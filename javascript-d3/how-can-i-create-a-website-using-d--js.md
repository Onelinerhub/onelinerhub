# How can I create a website using d3.js?
// plain

Creating a website using d3.js is relatively simple. You must first include the d3.js library in your HTML document. This can be done by adding a `<script>` tag with the src attribute set to the location of the d3.js file.

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```

Once the library is included, you can start writing the code to create the website. This can be done by using the d3.js functions to select elements in the HTML document and manipulate them.

For example, the following code will select the `<body>` element and set its background color to black:

```javascript
d3.select("body").style("background-color", "black");
```

You can also use d3.js to create and append elements to the HTML document. For example, the following code will create an `<h1>` element and append it to the `<body>` element:

```javascript
d3.select("body")
  .append("h1")
  .text("Hello World!");
```

These are just a few of the things that you can do with d3.js. For more information, you can refer to the [d3.js documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki).
