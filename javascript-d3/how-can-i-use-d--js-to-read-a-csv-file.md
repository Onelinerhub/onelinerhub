# How can I use D3.js to read a CSV file?
// plain

Using D3.js, you can read a CSV file by using the `d3.csv()` method. This method takes a file path and a callback function as arguments. The callback function is called when the file has been loaded.

```
d3.csv("data.csv", function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

This code will log the data from the CSV file to the console.

The parts of this code are:
- `d3.csv()`: This is a method from the D3 library that is used to read a CSV file.
- `"data.csv"`: This is the path of the CSV file to be read.
- `function(data)`: This is the callback function that will be called when the CSV file has been loaded.
- `console.log(data)`: This will log the data from the CSV file to the console.
