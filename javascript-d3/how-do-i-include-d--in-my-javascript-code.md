# How do I include D3 in my JavaScript code?
// plain

To include D3 in your JavaScript code, you first need to download the latest version of the library from the [D3 website](https://d3js.org/). After downloading the library, you can include it in your HTML page with a script tag, like this:

```
<script src="d3.min.js"></script>
```

Then, you can use D3 functions in your JavaScript code. For example, the following code creates an SVG element and adds some text to it:

```
var svg = d3.select("body").append("svg")
    .attr("width", 500)
    .attr("height", 300);

svg.append("text")
    .attr("x", 10)
    .attr("y", 20)
    .text("Hello, world!");
```

This code will output an SVG element with the text "Hello, world!" inside it.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. The first line creates a new SVG element and adds it to the body of the HTML page.
2. The second and third lines set the width and height of the SVG element.
3. The fourth line creates a new text element and adds it to the SVG element.
4. The last two lines set the x and y coordinates of the text element and set the text of the element.

For more information, you can take a look at the [D3 documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki).
