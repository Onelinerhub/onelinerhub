# How do I create a force layout using d3.js?
// plain

To create a force layout using d3.js, you can use the d3.forceSimulation() method. This method takes in an array of nodes and links and is used to create a force-directed graph. The following example code creates a simple force layout with two nodes and one link:

```
// Create nodes
let nodes = [
  {id: 1},
  {id: 2},
]

// Create links
let links = [
  {source: nodes[0], target: nodes[1]}
]

// Create the simulation
let simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
  .force("link", d3.forceLink(links).id(d => d.id))

// Start the simulation
simulation.on("tick", () => {
  console.log(nodes);
})
```

The output of the above code is an array of nodes with updated x and y coordinates:

```
[
  {id: 1, x: 0.8, y: -4.2},
  {id: 2, x: -3.6, y: 2.2}
]
```

The code consists of four parts:

1. Creating the nodes: An array of objects containing the node ids is created.
2. Creating the links: An array of objects containing the source and target nodes is created.
3. Creating the simulation: The d3.forceSimulation() method is used to create the simulation, and the d3.forceLink() method is used to create the link force.
4. Starting the simulation: The simulation is started by calling the on() method with "tick" as the argument, which will be called on every tick of the simulation.
