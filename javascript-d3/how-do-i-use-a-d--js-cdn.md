# How do I use a d3.js CDN?
// plain

Using a d3.js CDN is a simple way to include the d3.js library in your HTML. To use a CDN, include a script tag in your HTML, with the source attribute set to the CDN URL. For example:

```
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```

This will include the latest version of d3.js in your page.

You can also specify a specific version of d3.js by including the version number in the URL. For example:

```
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
```

This will include version 4 of d3.js in your page.

You can also specify a specific module of d3.js by including the module name in the URL. For example:

```
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-selection.v1.min.js"></script>
```

This will include the selection module of d3.js in your page.

Once you've included the d3.js library in your HTML, you can use the d3.js API to manipulate the DOM and create data visualizations.
