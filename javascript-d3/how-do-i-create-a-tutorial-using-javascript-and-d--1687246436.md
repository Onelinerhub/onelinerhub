# How do I create a tutorial using JavaScript and D3?
// plain

To create a tutorial using JavaScript and D3, you will need to have a basic understanding of both JavaScript and the D3 library.

First, you need to include the D3 library in your HTML page. This is done by adding the following code to the head of your HTML page:
```
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```

After the library is included, you can start writing your JavaScript code. To create a simple bar chart, you can use the following code:
```
var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];

d3.select(".chart")
  .selectAll("div")
    .data(data)
  .enter().append("div")
    .style("width", function(d) { return d * 10 + "px"; })
    .text(function(d) { return d; });
```

The code above does the following:
1. Declare a variable called data that contains an array of numbers
2. Select the HTML element with the class "chart"
3. Select all div elements within the chart element
4. Bind the data to the selected div elements
5. Append a div element for each data point
6. Set the width of each div element to 10 times the data point
7. Set the text of each div element to the data point

The output of the code above will be a bar chart with the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42.
