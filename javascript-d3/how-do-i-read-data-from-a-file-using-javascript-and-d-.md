# How do I read data from a file using JavaScript and D3?
// plain

Reading data from a file using JavaScript and D3 is relatively straightforward. You can use the `d3.csv()` method, which takes a file path as an argument and returns a promise with the contents of the file.

For example, if you have a CSV file called `myData.csv` in the same directory as your script, you could read it into a variable using the following code:
```javascript
d3.csv("myData.csv").then(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```
The output of this code would be the contents of the file, formatted as an array of objects:
```
[
  {name: "Bob", age: 24},
  {name: "Alice", age: 21},
  {name: "John", age: 27}
]
```

The code can be broken down into the following parts:
- `d3.csv()`: This is the method used to read in the CSV file.
- `"myData.csv"`: This is the path to the file that is being read in.
- `then()`: This is a promise that is called when the file is successfully read in.
- `function(data)`: This is the callback function that is called when the promise is fulfilled. The contents of the file are passed in as the `data` argument.
- `console.log(data)`: This is used to print out the contents of the file to the console.
