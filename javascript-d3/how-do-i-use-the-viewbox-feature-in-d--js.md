# How do I use the viewbox feature in d3.js?
// plain

The `viewbox` feature in d3.js is a powerful tool for creating responsive SVG elements. It allows you to define the size of the SVG element, and then scale it to fit the container element. This is useful for creating responsive charts and graphs that can be resized to fit any screen size.

To use the `viewbox` feature, you need to specify the `width` and `height` attributes of the SVG element, as well as the `viewBox` attribute. The `viewBox` attribute takes four parameters: `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`. These parameters define the area of the SVG element that will be visible.

Here is an example of how to use the `viewBox` attribute:

```
<svg width="400" height="400" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="red" />
</svg>
```

This example will create an SVG element with a width and height of 400 pixels, and a `viewBox` attribute that defines the visible area as a 100x100 square. The result will be a red circle with a radius of 50 pixels.
