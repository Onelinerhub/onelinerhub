# How do I create an animation using D3 JavaScript?
// plain

To create an animation using D3 JavaScript, you can use the `transition()` method. This method can be used to animate different elements in a webpage. Here is an example of how to use it:

```javascript
d3.select("#element")
    .transition()
    .duration(750)
    .style("background-color", "red");
```

This code will cause the element with the id `element` to transition from its current background color to red over a duration of 750 milliseconds.

The `transition()` method can also be used to animate other properties of an element, such as its position, size, or opacity. Here is an example of how to animate the position of an element:

```javascript
d3.select("#element")
    .transition()
    .duration(750)
    .style("left", "100px");
```

This code will cause the element with the id `element` to transition from its current position to a position that is 100 pixels to the right over a duration of 750 milliseconds.

The `transition()` method can also be used to animate multiple elements at once. Here is an example of how to do that:

```javascript
d3.selectAll(".elements")
    .transition()
    .duration(750)
    .style("background-color", "red");
```

This code will cause all elements with the class `elements` to transition from their current background color to red over a duration of 750 milliseconds.

## Code explanation


- `d3.select()`: Selects the element to be animated.
- `transition()`: Starts the animation.
- `duration()`: Sets the duration of the animation.
- `style()`: Sets the property to be animated.
