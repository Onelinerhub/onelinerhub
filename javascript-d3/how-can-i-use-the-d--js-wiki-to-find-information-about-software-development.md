// plain

The `d3.js` wiki is a great resource for finding information about software development. It contains tutorials, examples, and documentation on the various components of `d3.js`.

For example, to find information about the `d3.scale()` function, you can search the wiki for "d3.scale". This will bring up a page with detailed information about the function, including an example code block to illustrate its use:

```javascript
var x = d3.scale.linear()
    .domain([0, 100])
    .range([0, width]);
```

This code block creates a linear scale which maps values from the domain of 0 to 100 to a range of 0 to the variable `width`.

The `d3.js` wiki also contains a variety of tutorials and examples to help developers understand how to use `d3.js` in their software development projects. For example, the [Getting Started](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Getting-Started) page provides a brief introduction to `d3.js` and a few examples of how to use it.

In addition, the wiki contains a list of [resources](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Resources) for developers to explore, including books, tutorials, and other helpful materials.

Overall, the `d3.js` wiki is an invaluable resource for developers looking to learn more about `d3.js` and software development.
