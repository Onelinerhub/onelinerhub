How to integrate d3.js and Vue.js?
// plain

Integrating d3.js and Vue.js is a straightforward process. First, install the vue-d3-network library, which is an npm package that provides a set of components for creating and manipulating network graphs using d3.js and Vue.js. This library can be installed with the following command:

```
npm install vue-d3-network
```

Once the library is installed, it can be imported into a Vue component and used to create a network graph. The following example code creates a network graph with two nodes and a link between them:

```
import NetworkGraph from 'vue-d3-network'

export default {
  components: {
    NetworkGraph
  },
  data () {
    return {
      nodes: [
        { id: 'node1', label: 'Node 1' },
        { id: 'node2', label: 'Node 2' }
      ],
      links: [
        { source: 'node1', target: 'node2' }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The code above defines two nodes, `node1` and `node2`, and a link between them. The `NetworkGraph` component is then used to render the graph. The output of this code is a network graph with two nodes and a link between them:

The vue-d3-network library provides a set of components for creating and manipulating network graphs using d3.js and Vue.js. The code above is just a basic example of how to integrate d3.js and Vue.js, and there are many more features and options available. For more information, see the [vue-d3-network documentation](https://github.com/emilio-martinez/vue-d3-network).
