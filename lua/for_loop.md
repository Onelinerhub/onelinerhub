# Create a for loop

```lua
for i = 10,1,-1 
do 
   print(i) 
end
```

- for i = 10,1,-1  - the loop will run from the stsrting value of i as 10 till 1 with a decrement (because of negative sign) of 1. Therefore this loop will runs for 10 times
- do - statements to be evaluated comes after do
- print(i) - as an example, print statement is shown
- end - end of the loop

group: loop
