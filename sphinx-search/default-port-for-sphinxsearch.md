# Default port for SphinxSearch
// plain

The default port for SphinxSearch is `9312`. It is a full-text search engine written in C++ and designed to provide fast and relevant full-text search functionality to client applications.

SphinxSearch can be configured to use a different port by editing the `sphinx.conf` file.

## Example code

```
listen = 0.0.0.0:9312
```

This code sets the port to `9312`.

Parts of the code:
- `listen`: This is the keyword used to set the port.
- `0.0.0.0`: This is the IP address to listen on.
- `9312`: This is the port number.
