# How do I write Python code to use TensorFlow?
// plain

To write Python code to use TensorFlow, you need to install the TensorFlow library. This can be done using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow
```

Once the TensorFlow library is installed, you can import it into your Python code:

```
import tensorflow as tf
```

You can then use the library to define a TensorFlow graph:

```
# Create a graph
g = tf.Graph()

# Set the graph as the default graph
with g.as_default():
  # Define operations and tensors in the graph
  c = tf.constant(30.0)
  print(c)

# Output
Tensor("Const:0", shape=(), dtype=float32)
```

The code above creates a graph `g` and defines a constant tensor `c` with a value of `30.0`. Once the graph is created, you can use TensorFlow's API to define operations and tensors. After the graph is defined, you can use the `tf.Session()` function to execute the graph.

```
# Create a session to execute the graph
with tf.Session(graph=g) as sess:
  print(sess.run(c))

# Output
30.0
```

The code above creates a session `sess` and executes the graph `g`. The result of the execution is the value of the constant tensor `c`.
