# What is the purpose of using Python and TensorFlow together?
// plain

The purpose of using Python and TensorFlow together is to create powerful machine learning models and data analysis tools. Python is a high-level programming language that is used to write code for data analysis and machine learning. TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computation and machine learning, which is used to build powerful machine learning models. Together, Python and TensorFlow provide an effective platform for creating and training machine learning models.

## Example code

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a constant op
# This op is added as a node to the default graph
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')

# Start a TF session
sess = tf.Session()

# Run the op
print(sess.run(hello))
```
## Output example

```
b'Hello, TensorFlow!'
```

The code above is a basic example of how to use Python and TensorFlow together. The first line imports the TensorFlow library. The second line creates a constant operation, which is added to the default graph. The third line starts a TensorFlow session, and the fourth line runs the operation and prints the result.

## Code explanation

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This line imports the TensorFlow library.
2. `hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')`: This line creates a constant operation, which is added to the default graph.
3. `sess = tf.Session()`: This line starts a TensorFlow session.
4. `print(sess.run(hello))`: This line runs the operation and prints the result.
