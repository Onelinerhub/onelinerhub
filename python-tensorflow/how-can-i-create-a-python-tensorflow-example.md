# How can I create a Python TensorFlow example?
// plain

Creating a Python TensorFlow example is easy and can be done in a few steps.

1. First, import the TensorFlow library.
```
import tensorflow as tf
```

2. Then create a constant, which is a tensor that holds a value.
```
a = tf.constant(2)
```

3. Create a variable, which is a tensor that can change its value.
```
b = tf.Variable(2)
```

4. Create an operation to add the two tensors together.
```
c = a + b
```

5. Initialize the variables.
```
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
```

6. Create a session and run the operation.
```
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init)
    print(sess.run(c))
```

7. The output should be 4.
```
4
```

This is a basic example of using TensorFlow in Python. For more information, see the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/).
