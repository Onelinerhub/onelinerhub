# How do I use the Softmax function in Python Tensorflow?

The Softmax function is a mathematical function that is used to transform a vector of arbitrary real values into a vector of real values in the range (0,1) that add up to 1. It is commonly used in machine learning and deep learning applications, especially when dealing with classification problems.

In Python Tensorflow, the Softmax function can be used as follows:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a TensorFlow placeholder for a vector of arbitrary real values
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None])

# Apply the Softmax function to the vector
y = tf.nn.softmax(x)

# Initialize a session
with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Run the Softmax function
    result = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: [1, 2, 3]})
    # Print the result
    print(result)

# Output: [0.09003057 0.24472848 0.66524094]
```

The code above takes a vector of arbitrary real values (in this case, [1, 2, 3]) and applies the Softmax function to it. The result is a vector of real values in the range (0,1) that add up to 1.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import tensorflow as tf` - This imports the TensorFlow library.
2. `x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None])` - This creates a placeholder for a vector of arbitrary real values.
3. `y = tf.nn.softmax(x)` - This applies the Softmax function to the vector.
4. `with tf.Session() as sess:` - This initializes a session.
5. `result = sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: [1, 2, 3]})` - This runs the Softmax function with the vector of arbitrary real values.
6. `print(result)` - This prints the result.
