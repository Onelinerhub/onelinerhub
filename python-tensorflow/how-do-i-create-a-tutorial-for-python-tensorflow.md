# How do I create a tutorial for Python TensorFlow?
// plain

1. Begin by installing TensorFlow and setting up your environment. You can do this by following the instructions on the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

2. Next, you should create a simple program to get familiar with the basics of TensorFlow. For example, the following code creates a simple linear model:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create two variables.
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([784, 200], stddev=0.35),
                      name="weights")
biases = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([200]), name="biases")

# Add an operation to initialize the variables.
init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()

# Later, when launching the model
with tf.Session() as sess:
  # Run the init operation.
  sess.run(init_op)
```

3. This code creates two variables, `weights` and `biases`, and initializes them with random values.

4. You can then explain the code, line by line, and provide examples of how to use the various TensorFlow functions.

5. Once you have explained the basics, you can move on to more advanced topics, such as creating and training a neural network.

6. You should also provide resources such as tutorials, videos, and documentation to help readers learn more about TensorFlow.

7. Finally, you should include a section on troubleshooting, to help readers who are stuck with their code.
