# How can I use TensorFlow with Python?
// plain

TensorFlow is a powerful open source library for numerical computation, particularly well suited for machine learning. It can be used with Python to create and train machine learning models.

To use TensorFlow with Python, you need to install the TensorFlow library. You can do this using `pip`:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

Once you have installed the library, you can import it in your Python code:
```
import tensorflow as tf
```

You can then create and train your model with Python code. For example, you can create a simple linear regression model with the following code:
```
# Create the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(x, y, epochs=500)
```

You can also use TensorFlow with Python to perform other tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more.
