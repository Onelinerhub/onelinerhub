// plain

To learn about Python and TensorFlow, you can use a book as a reference. Here are some steps to help you get started:

1. Start by reading an introductory book on Python and TensorFlow. Examples include "TensorFlow for Deep Learning" by Bharath Ramsundar and Reza Bosagh Zadeh, or "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

2. Try out some of the code examples in the book. For example, the following code prints the version of TensorFlow installed on your computer:

```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```
## Output example
 `2.4.0`

3. As you read the book, practice the code examples in the book. This will help you understand the concepts better.

4. Make sure to check out the official documentation for Python and TensorFlow. This will provide you with more detailed information on the topics discussed in the book.

5. Consider taking online courses or attending workshops to learn more about Python and TensorFlow.

6. Look for online resources such as blogs, tutorials, and videos to supplement your learning.

7. Join online communities to ask questions and get help from experienced practitioners.
