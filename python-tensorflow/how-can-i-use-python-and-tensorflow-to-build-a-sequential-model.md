# How can I use Python and TensorFlow to build a sequential model?
// plain

Using Python and TensorFlow to build a sequential model is a straightforward process. To start, you'll need to import the necessary packages and create a sequential model object. For example:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential()
```

Next, you'll need to add layers to the model. This can be done using the `model.add()` method. For example:

```
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='softmax'))
```

Once the layers have been added, you'll need to compile the model. This is done using the `model.compile()` method. You'll need to specify the loss function, optimizer, and any metrics you'd like to track. For example:

```
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Finally, you'll need to fit the model to the data. This is done using the `model.fit()` method. You'll need to specify the training data, the number of epochs, and any other parameters you'd like to set. For example:

```
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

Epoch 1/5
1875/1875 [==============================] - 2s 1ms/step - loss: 0.5086 - accuracy: 0.8201
Epoch 2/5
1875/1875 [==============================] - 2s 1ms/step - loss: 0.3763 - accuracy: 0.8647
Epoch 3/5
1875/1875 [==============================] - 2s 1ms/step - loss: 0.3344 - accuracy: 0.8773
Epoch 4/5
1875/1875 [==============================] - 2s 1ms/step - loss: 0.3081 - accuracy: 0.8867
Epoch 5/5
1875/1875 [==============================] - 2s 1ms/step - loss: 0.2876 - accuracy: 0.8939
```

Once the model is fit, you can use it to make predictions.

#### Code Parts Explanation

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: this imports the TensorFlow package so that it can be used in the program.
2. `from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`: this imports the Sequential model from the Keras package.
3. `model = Sequential()`: this creates an empty sequential model object.
4. `model.add()`: this adds layers to the model.
5. `model.compile()`: this compiles the model, specifying the loss function, optimizer, and any metrics to track.
6. `model.fit()`: this fits the model to the data, specifying the training data, number of epochs, and any other parameters.
7. `model.predict()`: this can be used to make predictions using the trained model.
