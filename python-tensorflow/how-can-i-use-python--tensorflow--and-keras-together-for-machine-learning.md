# How can I use Python, TensorFlow, and Keras together for machine learning?
// plain

Python, TensorFlow, and Keras are powerful libraries for machine learning. They can be used together to quickly build and train models.

For example, the following code block can be used to create a simple feed-forward neural network using Keras and TensorFlow:
```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

This code block creates a 3-layer feed-forward neural network with 64 neurons in each layer. The first layer has an input shape of 784, which is the size of the input data. The last layer has 10 neurons, which corresponds to the number of classes the model is predicting.

Once the model is created, it can be compiled and trained using the following code block:
```
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
```

This code block compiles the model with the Adam optimizer and the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. It then trains the model for 5 epochs on the training data.

The following code block can be used to evaluate the model on the test data:
```
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)
```

This code block evaluates the model on the test data and prints out the accuracy.

In summary, Python, TensorFlow, and Keras can be used together to quickly build and train machine learning models.

## Code explanation


1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow library so it can be used in the code.
2. `from tensorflow import keras`: This imports the Keras library from TensorFlow so it can be used in the code.
3. `keras.Sequential([...]`: This creates a sequential model with the specified layers.
4. `model.compile(...)`: This compiles the model with the specified optimizer and loss function.
5. `model.fit(...)`: This trains the model on the specified data for the specified number of epochs.
6. `model.evaluate(...)`: This evaluates the model on the specified data and returns the loss and accuracy.
