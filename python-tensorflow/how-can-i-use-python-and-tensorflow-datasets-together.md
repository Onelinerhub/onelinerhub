# How can I use Python and TensorFlow Datasets together?
// plain

Python and TensorFlow Datasets can be used together to create powerful machine learning models. To do this, one must first install TensorFlow Datasets, which can be done by running `pip install tensorflow-datasets` in the terminal.

Once TensorFlow Datasets is installed, one can begin using it in Python. To get started, one can import the module as follows:
```
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
```

The following code snippet shows how to load a dataset from TensorFlow Datasets:
```
dataset = tfds.load('mnist', split='train')
```
This will load the MNIST dataset into `dataset`, which can then be used for further processing.

One can then use the data in `dataset` to create a machine learning model. For example, the following code snippet creates a simple neural network model using the data in `dataset`:
```
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(dataset, epochs=5)
```
This code snippet will create a simple neural network model and train it on the data in `dataset`.

In summary, Python and TensorFlow Datasets can be used together to create powerful machine learning models. To do this, one must first install TensorFlow Datasets, then import the module, and then use the data in the dataset to create a machine learning model.

## List of Code Parts with Detailed Explanation

1. `pip install tensorflow-datasets`: This command will install TensorFlow Datasets, which is necessary to use it in Python.
2. `import tensorflow_datasets as tfds`: This command will import the TensorFlow Datasets module, which can then be used in Python.
3. `dataset = tfds.load('mnist', split='train')`: This command will load the MNIST dataset into `dataset`, which can then be used for further processing.
4. `model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])`: This code snippet will create a simple neural network model.
5. `model.compile(optimizer='adam', ...)`: This command will compile the model with the specified optimizer and loss function.
6. `model.fit(dataset, epochs=5)`: This command will train the model on the data in `dataset` for 5 epochs.
