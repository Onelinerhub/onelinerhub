# How can I generate a random normal distribution using Python and TensorFlow?
// plain

Generating a random normal distribution using Python and TensorFlow is quite easy. To do so, we can use the `tf.random.normal()` function. This function takes two arguments: the shape of the output tensor and the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution.

For example, the following code block generates a random normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1:

```
import tensorflow as tf

normal_dist = tf.random.normal(shape=[2,3], mean=0, stddev=1)

print(normal_dist)
```

The output of the above code is:

```
tf.Tensor(
[[-1.0422163  -1.1837213   0.93375015]
 [ 0.09916094 -0.7462523  -1.2795391 ]], shape=(2, 3), dtype=float32)
```

The code can be broken down into the following parts:
1. Import the TensorFlow library: `import tensorflow as tf`
2. Generate the random normal distribution: `normal_dist = tf.random.normal(shape=[2,3], mean=0, stddev=1)`
3. Print the generated distribution: `print(normal_dist)`
