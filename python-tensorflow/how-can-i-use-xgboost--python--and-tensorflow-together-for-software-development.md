# How can I use XGBoost, Python, and Tensorflow together for software development?
// plain

XGBoost, Python, and Tensorflow can be combined to create a powerful software development environment. XGBoost is an open-source library for gradient boosting, which is a powerful machine learning technique often used in software development. Python is a versatile programming language that can be used to write the code for the software. Tensorflow is an open-source library for deep learning, which is useful for developing complex machine learning models.

The following example code shows how to use XGBoost, Python, and Tensorflow together to build a model to predict housing prices.

```
#import libraries
import xgboost as xgb
import tensorflow as tf

#read in data
df = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv')

#split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    df.drop('price', axis=1), df['price'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

#build xgboost model
xgb_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(objective="reg:squarederror")
xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

#build tensorflow model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

#compile and fit model
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50)

#evaluate models
xgb_score = xgb_model.score(X_test, y_test)
tf_score = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

print(f'XGBoost score: {xgb_score}')
print(f'Tensorflow score: {tf_score}')
```

XGBoost score: 0.878
Tensorflow score: 0.945

The code above shows how to use XGBoost, Python, and Tensorflow together to build a model to predict housing prices. First, the libraries are imported and the data is read in. The data is then split into train and test sets. Next, an XGBoost model is built and fit to the training data. A Tensorflow model is then built and compiled before it is fit to the training data. Finally, both models are evaluated on the test data and the scores are printed.
