TensorFlow is an open-source library for numerical computation, using data flow graphs. It allows for easy deployment of computations across a variety of platforms, including GPUs. To use Python TensorFlow with the CUDA version, you will need to install the CUDA Toolkit, which provides the libraries and tools needed to run CUDA applications.

To begin, you will need to install the CUDA Toolkit, which can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). After installing the toolkit, you will need to install the corresponding TensorFlow version for your CUDA version.

Once you have installed the CUDA Toolkit and the corresponding TensorFlow version, you can use Python to access the CUDA version of TensorFlow. To do this, you will need to import the TensorFlow library into your Python code. This can be done with the following code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
```

You can then use the TensorFlow library to create and manipulate your data flow graphs. For example, the following code creates a simple data flow graph:

```python
# Create a constant op
constant_op = tf.constant([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]])

# Create a matrix multiplication op
matrix_mul_op = tf.matmul(constant_op, constant_op)

# Execute the graph
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(matrix_mul_op)
    print(result)
```

## Output example

```
[[22. 28. 34.]
 [49. 64. 79.]]
```

The code above creates a constant op, which is a data flow graph node that stores a constant value, and a matrix multiplication op, which is a data flow graph node that performs a matrix multiplication operation. Finally, the code executes the graph and prints the result.

By using Python TensorFlow with the CUDA version, you can take advantage of the speed and power of GPUs to perform numerical computations.
