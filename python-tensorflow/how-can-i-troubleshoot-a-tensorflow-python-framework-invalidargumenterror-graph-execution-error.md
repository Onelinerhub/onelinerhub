# How can I troubleshoot a TensorFlow Python Framework InvalidArgumentError Graph Execution Error?
// plain

The TensorFlow Python Framework InvalidArgumentError Graph Execution Error is an error that occurs when the graph is constructed incorrectly or when the data being fed into the graph is invalid. To troubleshoot this error, one should first check the graph to make sure all of the nodes and edges have been properly defined. Additionally, one should check the data being fed into the graph to make sure it is valid and in the correct format.

The following example code block illustrates how to check the graph for errors:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a graph
g = tf.Graph()

# Check the graph for errors
with g.as_default():
    # Add nodes and edges
    # ...

    # Check for errors
    if not tf.is_valid_graph(g):
        raise ValueError('Graph is invalid.')
```

In addition to checking the graph for errors, one should also check the data being fed into the graph to make sure it is valid and in the correct format. The following example code block illustrates how to check the data being fed into the graph:

```
# Check the data
if not tf.is_valid_tensor(data):
    raise ValueError('Data is invalid.')
```

If both the graph and the data being fed into the graph are valid, then the error is likely due to an issue with the code. In this case, one should check the code for any errors or typos.

## Code explanation

1. Import TensorFlow
2. Create a graph
3. Check the graph for errors
4. Check the data being fed into the graph
