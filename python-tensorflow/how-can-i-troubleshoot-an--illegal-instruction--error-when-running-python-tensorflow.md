# How can I troubleshoot an "Illegal Instruction" error when running Python TensorFlow?
// plain

The "Illegal Instruction" error is a common issue when running Python TensorFlow. To troubleshoot this error, you should first check the version of TensorFlow that you are running. If it is not the latest version, you should update it.

You should also check to make sure that the hardware you are running TensorFlow on is compatible with the version of TensorFlow you are using.

Next, you should check your code for any syntax errors or typos. To do this, you can run the code in a Python interpreter and check the output for any errors.

For example:

```
$ python
>>> import tensorflow
>>> print(tensorflow.__version__)
2.3.0
```

This code checks the version of TensorFlow installed and prints it to the console.

Finally, you should check the system logs for any errors related to TensorFlow. This can help you identify any issues that may be causing the "Illegal Instruction" error.

## Code explanation


1. Check the version of TensorFlow that you are running and update it if necessary.
2. Check the hardware compatibility with the version of TensorFlow.
3. Check the code for any syntax errors or typos.
4. Check the system logs for any errors related to TensorFlow.
