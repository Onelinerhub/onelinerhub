# How do I use Python and TensorFlow for object detection?
// plain

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects in an image. Python and TensorFlow can be used to build object detection models. To do this, you need to create a TensorFlow model using an object detection API and train it on a labeled dataset.

Example code to use Python and TensorFlow for object detection:
```
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Load the model from TensorFlow Hub
model = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/faster_rcnn/openimages_v4/ssd/1")

# Load an image
image = tf.io.read_file("image.jpg")
image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image)

# Run the model to detect objects
predictions = model(image)

# Print the predictions
print(predictions)
```

## Output example

```

## Code explanation


1. Importing the necessary libraries - `import tensorflow as tf` and `import tensorflow_hub as hub`
2. Loading the model from TensorFlow Hub - `model = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/faster_rcnn/openimages_v4/ssd/1")`
3. Loading an image - `image = tf.io.read_file("image.jpg")` and `image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image)`
4. Running the model to detect objects - `predictions = model(image)`
5. Printing the predictions - `print(predictions)`
