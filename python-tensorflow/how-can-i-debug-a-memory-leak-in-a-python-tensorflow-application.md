# How can I debug a memory leak in a Python TensorFlow application?
// plain

1. First, you should isolate the code that is causing the memory leak. To do this, you can use the Python tool `gc.set_debug()` to find out which objects are not being released.

2. Once you have identified the code that is causing the memory leak, you can use the TensorFlow debugger (tfdbg) to trace the source of the leak. The tfdbg tool can be used to view the memory usage of your application and identify which objects are taking up the most memory.

3. You can also use the `tf.profiler` API to identify which operations are consuming the most memory. This will allow you to identify which operations are causing the memory leak.

4. You can also use the `tf.summary` API to monitor memory usage over time. This will allow you to identify if the memory usage is increasing over time, which could indicate a memory leak.

5. Finally, you can use the `tf.debugging` API to debug memory leaks. This API allows you to view the memory usage of individual operations and identify which operations are causing the memory leak.

## Example code


```
import gc
gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_LEAK)
```

## Output example


```
gc: collectable <dict 0x7f2f8d0d3d68>
gc: collectable <dict 0x7f2f8d0d4d00>
gc: collectable <dict 0x7f2f8d0d5c88>
```
