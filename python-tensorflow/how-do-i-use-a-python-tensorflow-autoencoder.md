# How do I use a Python Tensorflow Autoencoder?
// plain

An Autoencoder is a type of neural network that can be used to learn a compressed representation of data. It is composed of an encoder and a decoder, which are both neural networks. The encoder takes in the data and compresses it into a lower-dimensional representation, while the decoder takes the compressed representation and reconstructs the original data.

Using a Python Tensorflow Autoencoder is fairly simple. Here is an example of how to use one:

```
# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the encoder
def encoder(x):
    # Create the encoder layers
    layer1 = tf.layers.dense(x, 128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    layer2 = tf.layers.dense(layer1, 64, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    layer3 = tf.layers.dense(layer2, 32, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    # Return the encoded representation
    return layer3

# Define the decoder
def decoder(x):
    # Create the decoder layers
    layer1 = tf.layers.dense(x, 64, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    layer2 = tf.layers.dense(layer1, 128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
    layer3 = tf.layers.dense(layer2, 784, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid)
    # Return the reconstructed data
    return layer3

# Create the input placeholder
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 784])

# Create the encoder and decoder
encoded = encoder(x)
decoded = decoder(encoded)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
loss = tf.losses.mean_squared_error(x, decoded)
train_op = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimize(loss)

# Create a session to run the code
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # Train the model
    for i in range(1000):
        batch_x, _ = mnist.train.next_batch(128)
        sess.run(train_op, feed_dict={x: batch_x})

```

This code creates an Autoencoder in Python with Tensorflow. The encoder takes the input data and compresses it into a lower-dimensional representation. The decoder then takes the compressed representation and reconstructs the original data. The mean squared error is used as the loss function, and the Adam optimizer is used to minimize the loss. The model is then trained on batches of data for 1000 iterations.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Import necessary libraries - This imports the Tensorflow and Numpy libraries, which are necessary for building and running the model.
2. Define the encoder - This defines the encoder network, which takes the input data and compresses it into a lower-dimensional representation.
3. Define the decoder - This defines the decoder network, which takes the compressed representation and reconstructs the original data.
4. Create the input placeholder - This creates a placeholder for the input data.
5. Create the encoder and decoder - This creates the encoder and decoder networks.
6. Define the loss function and optimizer - This defines the mean squared error as the loss function and the Adam optimizer as the optimization algorithm.
7. Create a session to run the code - This creates a Tensorflow session to run the code.
8. Train the model - This trains the model on batches of data for 1000 iterations.
