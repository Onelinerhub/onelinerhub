# How do I install TensorFlow.js for Python?
// plain

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and in Node.js. It can be used with Python through the TensorFlow.js API.

To install TensorFlow.js for Python, you need to install the TensorFlow.js Python package. This can be done with the following command:

```
pip install tensorflowjs
```

Once the package is installed, you can use it in your Python code. For example:

```
import tensorflowjs as tfjs

model = tfjs.converters.load_keras_model('my_model.h5')
```

The code above loads a Keras model from the file `my_model.h5` and stores it in the `model` variable.

To learn more about how to use TensorFlow.js in Python, see the [TensorFlow.js documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials).
