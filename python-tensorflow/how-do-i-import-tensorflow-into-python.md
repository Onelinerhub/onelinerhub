# How do I import TensorFlow into Python?
// plain

To import TensorFlow into Python, you can use the following code block:

```
import tensorflow as tf
```

This code will import TensorFlow as a Python library and assign it to the `tf` variable.

To verify that TensorFlow was imported correctly, you can run the following code block:

```
print(tf.__version__)
```

This code will print out the version of TensorFlow that was imported.

## Code explanation


* `import` - used to import external libraries into Python
* `tensorflow` - the TensorFlow library
* `as` - used to assign the imported library to a variable
* `tf` - the variable assigned to the TensorFlow library
* `print()` - used to print out the version of TensorFlow
* `__version__` - the attribute of the TensorFlow library that holds its version
