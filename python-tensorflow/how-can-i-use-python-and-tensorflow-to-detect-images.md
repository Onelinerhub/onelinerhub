# How can I use Python and TensorFlow to detect images?
// plain

Python and TensorFlow are powerful tools for detecting images. To use them together, you need to first install TensorFlow and its dependencies. Then, you can create a Python script that loads an image, passes it through a TensorFlow model, and then prints out the results.

For example, here is a code block that loads an image, passes it through a TensorFlow model, and then prints out the results:
```
import tensorflow as tf

# Load image
image = tf.io.read_file('image.jpg')

# Pass image through model
result = model.predict(image)

# Print results
print(result)
```
The output of this code will be the results of the model's prediction.

## Code explanation

1. Import TensorFlow: `import tensorflow as tf`
2. Load the image: `image = tf.io.read_file('image.jpg')`
3. Pass the image through the model: `result = model.predict(image)`
4. Print the results: `print(result)`
