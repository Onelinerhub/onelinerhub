# How do I use w3schools to learn Python TensorFlow tutorials?
// plain

1. To learn Python TensorFlow tutorials using w3schools, you can go to the [Python TensorFlow Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tensorflow.asp) page.

2. This page provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of TensorFlow, including how to install it and how to use it for various tasks.

3. For example, you can learn how to create a basic TensorFlow model with the following code block:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a TensorFlow constant
const = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Create a TensorFlow variable
var = tf.Variable([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Create a TensorFlow placeholder
placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[2, 2])

# Create a TensorFlow operation
op = tf.add(const, var)

# Create a TensorFlow session
sess = tf.Session()

# Run the TensorFlow session
result = sess.run(op)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Output example

```
[[ 6  8]
 [10 12]]
```

4. The page also provides a list of code parts with detailed explanation, which can be used to understand the code better.

5. Additionally, there are several other resources available on the w3schools website which can help you learn Python TensorFlow, including [Python TensorFlow Examples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tensorflow_examples.asp) and [Python TensorFlow Quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tensorflow_quiz.asp).

6. You can also refer to the official [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) for more information.

7. Finally, there are many online tutorials and courses available to help you learn Python TensorFlow, such as [TensorFlow Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/), [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice), and [Udacity's Intro to TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187).
