# How can I use Python and TensorFlow to make predictions?
// plain

You can use Python and TensorFlow to make predictions by creating a model that takes in input data and returns a prediction. To do this, you will need to define the model architecture, compile the model, and then fit the model to your data.

## Example code

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(32,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

The code above defines a model architecture with three layers, compiles the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, and then fits the model to the training data.

## Code explanation

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow library into the program.
2. `model = tf.keras.Sequential([ ... ])`: This defines the model architecture, which is a sequence of layers with 64 neurons and ReLU activation in the first two layers, and a single neuron with sigmoid activation in the output layer.
3. `model.compile( ... )`: This compiles the model with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
4. `model.fit( ... )`: This fits the model to the training data, running for 10 epochs.
