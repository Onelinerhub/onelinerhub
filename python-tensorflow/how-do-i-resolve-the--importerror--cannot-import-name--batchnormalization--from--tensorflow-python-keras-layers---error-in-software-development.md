# How do I resolve the "ImportError: cannot import name 'batchnormalization' from 'tensorflow.python.keras.layers'" error in software development?
// plain

The "ImportError: cannot import name 'batchnormalization' from 'tensorflow.python.keras.layers'" error is encountered when attempting to import the `BatchNormalization` layer from TensorFlow's `tf.keras.layers` module.

In order to resolve this error, you must first ensure that you are using an up-to-date version of TensorFlow. To check the installed version, you can use the following code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

## Output example

```
2.3.0
```

If you are using an outdated version, you can update TensorFlow by running the following command (for pip):

```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

Once you have updated TensorFlow, you should be able to import the `BatchNormalization` layer without any errors. You can do this by using the following code:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization
```

If you are still encountering an error, it may be due to a corrupt installation of TensorFlow. To resolve this, you can uninstall and reinstall TensorFlow using the following command:

```
pip uninstall tensorflow
pip install tensorflow
```

If you are still experiencing issues, you may need to consult the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization) for more information.
