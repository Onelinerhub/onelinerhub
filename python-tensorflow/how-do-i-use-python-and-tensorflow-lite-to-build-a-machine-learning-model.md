# How do I use Python and TensorFlow Lite to build a machine learning model?
// plain

Using Python and TensorFlow Lite, you can build a machine learning model for your project. Here is an example of how to do this:

```
# Import the TensorFlow Lite library
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="relu", input_shape=(4,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation="softmax"),
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(
    optimizer="adam",
    loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)

# Train the model
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10)
```

After training the model, you can use the `TensorFlow Lite Converter` to convert the model into a TensorFlow Lite model. Then you can deploy the model to your device for inference.

Here are the parts of the code explained in detail:

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow library.
2. `model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([...])`: This creates a model using the Keras Sequential API.
3. `model.compile(...)`: This compiles the model with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
4. `model.fit(...)`: This trains the model on the data and labels.
5. `TensorFlow Lite Converter`: This converts the model into a TensorFlow Lite model.
