# How can I compile Python TensorFlow code online?

You can compile Python TensorFlow code online using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It is a free online platform for data science and machine learning.

In order to compile Python TensorFlow code online with Google Colab, you need to install the TensorFlow library. Here is an example code block:
```
!pip install tensorflow
```

This code will install the TensorFlow library. Once the library is installed, you can write and compile your own TensorFlow code.

Here is an example code block:
```
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant(2.0)
y = tf.constant(3.0)
z = x * y

with tf.Session() as sess:
    output = sess.run(z)
    print(output)
```
This code will print the result of multiplying 2.0 and 3.0 which is 6.0.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Importing the TensorFlow library as `tf`: `import tensorflow as tf`
2. Creating a constant `x` with the value of 2.0: `x = tf.constant(2.0)`
3. Creating a constant `y` with the value of 3.0: `y = tf.constant(3.0)`
4. Multiplying `x` and `y` and saving the result as `z`: `z = x * y`
5. Creating a session to run the code: `with tf.Session() as sess:`
6. Running the session to get the output of `z`: `output = sess.run(z)`
7. Printing the output of `z`: `print(output)`
