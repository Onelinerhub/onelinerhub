# How can I use the reshape attribute in TensorFlow's Python framework?
// plain

The `reshape` attribute in TensorFlow's Python framework is used to change the shape of an existing tensor without changing its data. It is used to convert a tensor from one shape to another without altering the data within the tensor.

## Example code

```
import tensorflow as tf
# Create a constant tensor
const_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Reshape the tensor
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(const_tensor, [3, 3])

# Print the reshaped tensor
print(reshaped_tensor)
```

## Output example

```
tf.Tensor(
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]], shape=(3, 3), dtype=int32)
```

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow library.
2. `const_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])`: This creates a constant tensor with the given values.
3. `reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(const_tensor, [3, 3])`: This uses the `reshape` attribute to change the shape of the constant tensor from (9,) to (3, 3).
4. `print(reshaped_tensor)`: This prints the reshaped tensor.
