### Installing TensorFlow offline using Python

1. Download the appropriate version of TensorFlow from the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).
2. Extract the files and navigate to the directory where the files are located.
3. Use the `pip install` command to install the package. For example:
```
pip install --user --upgrade ./tensorflow-1.15.2-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
```
4. This will install the TensorFlow package into the local Python environment.
5. To verify the installation, open a Python shell and type `import tensorflow as tf`.
6. If the installation is successful, no errors will be printed.
7. To learn more about using TensorFlow, check out the [official documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/).
