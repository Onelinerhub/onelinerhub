# How do I evaluate a model using Python and TensorFlow?
// plain

To evaluate a model using Python and TensorFlow, you need to measure the performance of your model against a test dataset. This is done by comparing the model's predictions with the true labels of the test dataset.

First, you need to define the metrics you want to use to evaluate your model. For example, if you are using a classification model, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score would be useful.

Next, you need to create a TensorFlow session and initialize the variables.

```
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
```

Then, you can use the `tf.metrics.accuracy()` function to compute the accuracy of your model. This function takes two arguments: the labels of the test dataset and the predictions of the model.

```
accuracy, accuracy_op = tf.metrics.accuracy(labels=y_test, predictions=y_pred)
```

Finally, you can run the accuracy operation in the TensorFlow session and get the accuracy of your model.

```
accuracy_value = sess.run(accuracy_op)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_value)
```
## Output example
 `Accuracy: 0.8`

## Code explanation
**
1. `sess = tf.Session()`: This creates a TensorFlow session.
2. `sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())`: This initializes the variables of the TensorFlow session.
3. `accuracy, accuracy_op = tf.metrics.accuracy(labels=y_test, predictions=y_pred)`: This computes the accuracy of the model using the labels of the test dataset and the predictions of the model.
4. `accuracy_value = sess.run(accuracy_op)`: This runs the accuracy operation in the TensorFlow session and gets the accuracy of the model.
