// plain

Installing TensorFlow on a Mac using Python is a relatively simple process.

1. First, install Python 3.7 or higher. This can be done by downloading the installer from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Next, open a terminal window and create a virtual environment. This can be done using the command:
```
python3 -m venv env
```

3. Activate the virtual environment using the command:
```
source env/bin/activate
```

4. Install TensorFlow using the command:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

5. To check that TensorFlow is installed correctly, run the following code in Python:
```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```
The output should be the version of TensorFlow that is installed.

6. Finally, deactivate the virtual environment using the command:
```
deactivate
```

Once these steps have been completed, TensorFlow should be successfully installed on your Mac.
