// plain

The "python tensorflow not found" error is usually caused by an incorrect installation of TensorFlow. To resolve this error, you must first install TensorFlow on your system. This can be done using pip, the Python package manager.

To install TensorFlow, open your terminal and enter the following command:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

This will install the latest version of TensorFlow on your system. If you would like to install a specific version, you can add the version number after the command:
```
pip install tensorflow==2.3.0
```

Once TensorFlow has been installed, you can import it into your Python script using the following code:
```
import tensorflow as tf
```

If you are still having trouble installing TensorFlow, you can find more detailed instructions on the official [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

If you have already installed TensorFlow but are still getting the "python tensorflow not found" error, it may be due to an incorrect version of Python. Make sure that you are using the same version of Python that you used to install TensorFlow.
