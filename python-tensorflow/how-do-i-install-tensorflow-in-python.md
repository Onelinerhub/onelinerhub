# How do I install TensorFlow in Python?
// plain

To install TensorFlow in Python, you need to first make sure that you have Python installed. You can check this by running `python --version` in your command line.

Once you have Python installed, you can install TensorFlow using `pip` with the following command: `pip install tensorflow`.

You can also install a specific version of TensorFlow by using `pip install tensorflow==<version>` where `<version>` is the version you want to install.

You can check if your installation was successful by running `python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)'` in your command line, which should output something like `2.2.0`.

If you need more help with the installation process, you can refer to the [TensorFlow installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
