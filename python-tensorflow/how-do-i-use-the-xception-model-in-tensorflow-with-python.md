# How do I use the Xception model in TensorFlow with Python?
// plain

The Xception model is a deep learning model developed by Google and introduced in their paper [1] in 2017. It is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and increase the performance of the network. The Xception model can be used in TensorFlow with Python using the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.keras as keras
from tensorflow.keras.applications.xception import Xception
```

2. Load the Xception model with weights pre-trained on ImageNet:
```python
model = Xception(weights='imagenet')
```

3. Compile the model with a suitable optimizer and loss function:
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
```

4. Fit the model on the training data:
```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

5. Evaluate the model on the test data:
```python
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print("Test accuracy:", score[1])
```

6. Make predictions on new data:
```python
predictions = model.predict(x_new)
```

7. Save the model for future use:
```python
model.save('xception.h5')
```
