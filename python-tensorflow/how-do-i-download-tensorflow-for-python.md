// plain

To download TensorFlow for Python, you can use `pip`, a package manager for Python.

```
pip install tensorflow
```

This will install the latest version of TensorFlow. If you want to install a specific version, you can use the `--pre` flag, followed by the version number:

```
pip install tensorflow==1.15.0 --pre
```

If you are using a virtual environment, you can also use `pipenv` to install TensorFlow:

```
pipenv install tensorflow
```

You can also download and install TensorFlow from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).

If you are using Anaconda, you can install TensorFlow using the `conda` command:

```
conda install -c anaconda tensorflow
```

You can find more information about installing TensorFlow on the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
