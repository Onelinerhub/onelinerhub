# How can I use the pywrap_tensorflow module in TensorFlow?
// plain

The pywrap_tensorflow module is a Python binding for the TensorFlow C API. It allows you to access the TensorFlow C API from Python. It can be used to create, manipulate, and execute TensorFlow graphs.

To use the pywrap_tensorflow module, you must first install TensorFlow. Once installed, you can import the module using the following code:

```
import pywrap_tensorflow
```

Once imported, you can use the various functions and classes provided by the module to create and manipulate TensorFlow graphs. For example, you can use the Graph class to create a new graph:

```
g = pywrap_tensorflow.Graph()
```

You can also use the Session class to execute operations on the graph:

```
sess = pywrap_tensorflow.Session(graph=g)
```

The module also provides functions for creating and manipulating tensors, such as `pywrap_tensorflow.zeros()` and `pywrap_tensorflow.constant()`.

For more information, see the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/pywrap_tensorflow).
