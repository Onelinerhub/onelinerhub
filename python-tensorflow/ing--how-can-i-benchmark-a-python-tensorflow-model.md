How can I benchmark a Python Tensorflow model?
// plain

Benchmarking a Python TensorFlow model can be done by using the TensorFlow's `tf.test.Benchmark` module. This module helps in measuring the performance of a model by running it multiple times and comparing the results. Here is an example of how to use this module:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(32,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Run the benchmark
benchmark_results = tf.test.Benchmark().run_op_benchmark(model)
```

The `tf.test.Benchmark` module will run the model multiple times and compare the results. This will help in determining the performance of the model. The output of the above code will be a dictionary containing the results of the benchmark, such as the average time taken to run, the maximum time taken to run, the minimum time taken to run, etc.

The following are the parts of the code:
1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow library.
2. `model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])`: This creates the model.
3. `benchmark_results = tf.test.Benchmark().run_op_benchmark(model)`: This runs the benchmark and stores the results in the `benchmark_results` variable.
