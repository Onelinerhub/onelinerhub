# How do I create a neural network using Python and TensorFlow?
// plain

Creating a neural network using Python and TensorFlow is a simple process. Here is an example of a basic neural network:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Provide the data
xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ys = [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3]

# Train the model
model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)

# Make a prediction
print(model.predict([7.0]))

# Output
[[4.0037344]]
```

The code above creates a simple neural network using TensorFlow's `Sequential` model. The `Sequential` model is a linear stack of layers. The first layer is a `Dense` layer with 1 unit and an input shape of 1. The model is then compiled with the `sgd` (stochastic gradient descent) optimizer and `mean_squared_error` loss function. The dataset is provided in the `xs` and `ys` variables. Finally, the model is trained with the `fit` function for 500 epochs. After training, the model can be used to make predictions, as demonstrated by the `predict` function.

The parts of the code are as follows:

1. `import tensorflow as tf` - imports the TensorFlow library.
2. `model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])` - creates a `Sequential` model with a `Dense` layer.
3. `model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')` - compiles the model with the `sgd` optimizer and `mean_squared_error` loss function.
4. `model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)` - trains the model with the provided dataset for 500 epochs.
5. `print(model.predict([7.0]))` - makes a prediction with the trained model.
