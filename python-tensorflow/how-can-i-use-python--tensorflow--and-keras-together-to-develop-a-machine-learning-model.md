# How can I use Python, TensorFlow, and Keras together to develop a machine learning model?
// plain

Python, TensorFlow, and Keras can be used together to develop a machine learning model. First, you will need to import the relevant libraries. For example:
```
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
```

Next, you will need to define the model. This can be done by creating a Sequential model with Keras. For example:
```
model = keras.Sequential()
```

Then, you will need to add layers to the model. This can be done with the add() method. For example:
```
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
```

After that, you will need to compile the model. This can be done with the compile() method. For example:
```
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='sgd',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Next, you will need to train the model. This can be done with the fit() method. For example:
```
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
```

Finally, you will need to evaluate the model. This can be done with the evaluate() method. For example:
```
loss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)
```

Parts of code:
- `import tensorflow as tf`: imports the TensorFlow library
- `import keras`: imports the Keras library
- `model = keras.Sequential()`: creates a Sequential model
- `model.add(keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))`: adds a dense layer to the model with 64 nodes, a ReLU activation function, and an input dimension of 100
- `model.add(keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))`: adds a dense layer to the model with 10 nodes and a softmax activation function
- `model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='sgd', metrics=['accuracy'])`: compiles the model with a categorical crossentropy loss function, Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer, and accuracy metric
- `model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)`: trains the model with the training data for 5 epochs
- `loss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)`: evaluates the model with the test data
