Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that allows agents to learn how to interact with an environment by performing actions and observing the rewards it receives. With Python and TensorFlow, we can implement RL algorithms to train agents to solve various tasks.

For example, to implement a Q-learning agent, we can use the following code:
```
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the Q-Table
q_table = np.zeros([env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n])

# Define the learning rate
learning_rate = 0.8

# Define the discount rate
discount_rate = 0.95

# Define the exploration rate
exploration_rate = 0.1

# Define the number of episodes
num_episodes = 2000

# Create lists to contain total rewards and steps per episode
rList = []

# Start the Q-Learning algorithm
for i in range(num_episodes):
    # Reset the environment
    s = env.reset()
    rAll = 0
    done = False

    # The Q-Table learning algorithm
    while not done:
        # Choose an action by greedily (with noise) picking from Q table
        a = np.argmax(q_table[s,:] + np.random.randn(1,env.action_space.n)*(1./(i+1)))

        # Get new state and reward from environment
        s1,r,done,_ = env.step(a)

        # Update Q-Table with new knowledge
        q_table[s,a] = q_table[s,a] + learning_rate*(r + discount_rate*np.max(q_table[s1,:]) - q_table[s,a])

        rAll += r
        s = s1
    rList.append(rAll)

print("Score over time: " +  str(sum(rList)/num_episodes))
```

The code above implements a Q-learning agent, which is the most basic form of RL. It consists of the following parts:

1. Initialize the Q-Table: This is an array that stores the agent's knowledge of the environment.
2. Set the learning rate, discount rate, and exploration rate: These are hyperparameters that control the agent's learning process.
3. Create lists to store total rewards and steps per episode: This will be used to track the agent's performance over time.
4. Start the Q-Learning algorithm: This is the main loop of the code, where the agent interacts with the environment and updates its knowledge.
