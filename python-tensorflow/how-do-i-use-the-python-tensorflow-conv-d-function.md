# How do I use the Python TensorFlow Conv2D function?
// plain

The Conv2D function in Python TensorFlow is used to create a 2D convolutional layer in a neural network. It is used to detect patterns in images by sliding a convolution filter over the image and calculating the dot product of the filter and the image.

## Example code

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a convolutional layer
conv2d_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), strides=(1,1), padding='same', activation='relu')
```

The code above creates a convolutional layer with 32 filters, a 3x3 kernel size, strides of 1, and a ReLU activation function.

The parts of the code are as follows:
* `filters` - the number of filters in the convolutional layer
* `kernel_size` - the size of the convolutional filter
* `strides` - the size of the strides used when sliding the filter over the image
* `padding` - the type of padding used to handle the edges of the image
* `activation` - the activation function used to calculate the output of the filter
