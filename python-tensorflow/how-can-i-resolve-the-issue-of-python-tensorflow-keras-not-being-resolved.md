# How can I resolve the issue of Python Tensorflow.keras not being resolved?
// plain

1. To resolve the issue of Python Tensorflow.keras not being resolved, the first step is to ensure that the Tensorflow package is installed correctly. To check this, open the terminal and type `pip list` to view all the packages installed. If Tensorflow is not listed, then it can be installed by running the command `pip install tensorflow`.

2. After the installation is complete, the Tensorflow.keras module can be imported into the program by adding `import tensorflow.keras` at the top of the program.

3. If the module still cannot be imported, then it is likely that the version of Tensorflow installed is incompatible with the version of Python being used. To solve this issue, the version of Tensorflow must be changed to match the version of Python being used.

4. If the version of Tensorflow is already compatible with the version of Python, then it may be necessary to upgrade the version of Tensorflow to the latest version. This can be done by running the command `pip install --upgrade tensorflow`.

5. If the issue still persists, then it may be necessary to uninstall and reinstall the Tensorflow package. To do this, run the command `pip uninstall tensorflow` followed by `pip install tensorflow`.

6. If the issue still cannot be resolved, then it may be necessary to check the system environment variables and ensure that the correct paths are being used.

7. If the issue still cannot be resolved, then it may be necessary to check the system logs for any errors related to Tensorflow.

## Example code

```
import tensorflow

print(tensorflow.__version__)
```

## Output example

```
2.3.1
```
