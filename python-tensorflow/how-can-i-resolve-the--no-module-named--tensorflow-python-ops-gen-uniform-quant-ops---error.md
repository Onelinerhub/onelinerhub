# How can I resolve the "No module named 'tensorflow.python.ops.gen_uniform_quant ops'" error?
// plain

This error occurs when you try to use a TensorFlow function that is not available in your version of TensorFlow. To resolve this error, you need to upgrade your TensorFlow installation to a version that supports the function you are trying to use.

For example, if you are using TensorFlow 2.0, you need to upgrade to TensorFlow 2.1 or later to use the `tf.quantization.uniform_quantize` function.

You can upgrade TensorFlow by running the following command:

```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

The output of this command should look something like this:

```
Collecting tensorflow

    Found existing installation: tensorflow 2.0.0
    Uninstalling tensorflow-2.0.0:
      Successfully uninstalled tensorflow-2.0.0
Successfully installed tensorflow-2.3.1
```

Once you have updated your TensorFlow installation, you should be able to use the `tf.quantization.uniform_quantize` function without any errors.

## Code explanation
**

1. `pip install --upgrade tensorflow` - This command upgrades your TensorFlow installation to the latest version.

2. `tf.quantization.uniform_quantize` - This is the TensorFlow function that was causing the error.
