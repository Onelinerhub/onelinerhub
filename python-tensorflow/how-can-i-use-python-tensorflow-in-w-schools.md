# How can I use Python TensorFlow in W3Schools?
// plain

Unfortunately, W3Schools does not support Python TensorFlow. However, you can still learn about TensorFlow on W3Schools. W3Schools provides an introduction to TensorFlow, including basic concepts, terminology, and installation instructions. You can also find tutorials on how to use TensorFlow for various tasks, such as image recognition and natural language processing.

If you want to use Python TensorFlow, you can install it on your computer and use it with your favorite IDE. For example, you can install TensorFlow using `pip`:

```
pip install tensorflow
```

Once TensorFlow is installed, you can start writing Python code to use it. For example, the following code creates a simple TensorFlow graph:

```
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(5.0)
b = tf.constant(6.0)

c = a * b

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(c))
```

The output of this code is `30.0`.

## Code explanation

* `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow Python library.
* `a = tf.constant(5.0)`: This creates a TensorFlow constant with the value `5.0`.
* `b = tf.constant(6.0)`: This creates a TensorFlow constant with the value `6.0`.
* `c = a * b`: This creates a TensorFlow operation which multiplies `a` and `b`.
* `with tf.Session() as sess:`: This creates a TensorFlow session.
* `print(sess.run(c))`: This runs the TensorFlow graph and prints the output.
