# How do I check which version of TensorFlow I am using with Python?
// plain

To check which version of TensorFlow you are using with Python, you can use the following code:

```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

This will print out the version of TensorFlow you are using, e.g. `2.2.0`.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow module and assigns it to the variable `tf`.
2. `print(tf.__version__)`: This prints out the version of TensorFlow you are using.
