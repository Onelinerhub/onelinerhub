# How can I use Python and TensorFlow to create a neural network?
// plain

To create a neural network using Python and TensorFlow, first you need to import the TensorFlow library:
```
import tensorflow as tf
```

Then, you need to define the input and output layers of the neural network. For example, if we are creating a neural network for a classification task, the input layer could be an array of features and the output layer could be a single class label.

Next, you need to define the weights and biases of the neural network. This can be done using the `tf.Variable` class.

```
# Define weights
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([num_inputs, num_outputs]))

# Define biases
biases = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([num_outputs]))
```

Once the weights and biases are defined, you can then define the model of the neural network. This can be done using the `tf.matmul` and `tf.add` functions.

```
# Define model
model = tf.add(tf.matmul(inputs, weights), biases)
```

Finally, you need to define the loss function and the optimizer. This can be done using the `tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy` and `tf.train.AdamOptimizer` classes respectively.

```
# Define loss function
loss = tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy(labels=labels, logits=model)

# Define optimizer
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimize(loss)
```

Once the model is defined, you can then train it using the `tf.Session` class.

```
# Initialize session
sess = tf.Session()

# Initialize variables
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

# Train model
for i in range(num_epochs):
    sess.run(optimizer, feed_dict={inputs: train_inputs, labels: train_labels})

# Test model
predictions = sess.run(model, feed_dict={inputs: test_inputs})
```

This is a basic example of how to use Python and TensorFlow to create a neural network.
