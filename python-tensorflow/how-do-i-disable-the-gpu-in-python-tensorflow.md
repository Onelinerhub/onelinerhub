# How do I disable the GPU in Python Tensorflow?
// plain

To disable the GPU in Python Tensorflow, you need to set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to an empty string. This can be done using the following code:

```
import os
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = ""
```

This will disable the GPU and cause Tensorflow to run on the CPU.

The code consists of two parts:

1. `import os`: This imports the `os` module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
2. `os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = ""`: This sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to an empty string. This will cause Tensorflow to ignore any GPUs present on the system and run on the CPU.
