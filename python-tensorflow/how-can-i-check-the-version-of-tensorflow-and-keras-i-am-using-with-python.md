# How can I check the version of TensorFlow and Keras I am using with Python?
// plain

To check the version of TensorFlow and Keras you are using with Python, you can use the following code block:
```
import tensorflow as tf
import keras

print(tf.__version__)
print(keras.__version__)
```
The output of the code will be the version of TensorFlow and Keras you are using:
```
2.1.0
2.3.1
```

The code block consists of the following parts:
1. `import tensorflow as tf` - imports the TensorFlow library and assigns it to the variable `tf`.
2. `import keras` - imports the Keras library.
3. `print(tf.__version__)` - prints out the version of TensorFlow you are using.
4. `print(keras.__version__)` - prints out the version of Keras you are using.
