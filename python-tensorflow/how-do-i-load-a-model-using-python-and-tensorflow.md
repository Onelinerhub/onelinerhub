# How do I load a model using Python and TensorFlow?
// plain

Loading a model using Python and TensorFlow is a simple process. To do so, the following code can be used:

```
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')
```

This code imports the TensorFlow library, then loads the model from the file `model.h5`.

The code can be broken down into the following parts:

* `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow library, allowing it to be used in the code.
* `model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')`: This loads the model from the file `model.h5`.

For more information, see the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/load_model).
