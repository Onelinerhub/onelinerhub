# How can I troubleshoot an issue where Python module TensorFlow.Keras is not found?
// plain

1. First, check that you have the latest version of TensorFlow installed. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal: ```pip install --upgrade tensorflow```.

2. If the issue persists, you can try to manually install the TensorFlow.Keras module by running the following command in the terminal: ```pip install tensorflow-keras```.

3. After installation, you should check that the module is successfully installed by running the following code in the Python interpreter: ```import tensorflow.keras```. If the module is successfully installed, you should see the following output: ```<module 'tensorflow.keras' from '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/keras/__init__.py'>```.

4. If you still cannot find the module, you can try to check if the module is present in the list of installed packages by running the following command in the terminal: ```pip list```.

5. If the module is not present in the list, you can try to reinstall the module by running the following command in the terminal: ```pip uninstall tensorflow-keras``` followed by ```pip install tensorflow-keras```.

6. If the issue still persists, you can try to check if the module is installed in the correct path by running the following command in the terminal: ```pip show tensorflow-keras```.

7. Finally, if the issue still persists, you can try to find more information by searching for troubleshooting guides online or by asking questions in relevant forums.
