**Using Layers in TensorFlow Keras with Python**

TensorFlow Keras is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models in Python. Layers are the building blocks of deep learning models, and they can be used to add trainable parameters to a model. Here is an example of how to use layers in TensorFlow Keras with Python:

```
# Importing the Keras library
import tensorflow.keras as keras

# Creating a sequential model
model = keras.Sequential()

# Adding a dense layer
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'))

# Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Fitting the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This code will create a sequential model, add a dense layer with 32 neurons and a ReLU activation function, compile the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function, and then fit the model to the training data for 10 epochs.

## Code explanation


1. `import tensorflow.keras as keras`: This imports the Keras library from TensorFlow.
2. `model = keras.Sequential()`: This creates a sequential model.
3. `model.add(keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'))`: This adds a dense layer with 32 neurons and a ReLU activation function.
4. `model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')`: This compiles the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
5. `model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)`: This fits the model to the training data for 10 epochs.
