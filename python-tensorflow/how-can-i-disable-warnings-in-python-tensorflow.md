// plain

To disable warnings in Python TensorFlow, you can use the `tf.logging.set_verbosity` function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.ERROR)
```

This will suppress all TensorFlow related warnings.

## Code explanation


- `tf.logging.set_verbosity`: This is the function used to set the verbosity of the TensorFlow logging system.
- `tf.logging.ERROR`: This is the argument to `tf.logging.set_verbosity` that sets the verbosity to the lowest level, suppressing all warnings.
