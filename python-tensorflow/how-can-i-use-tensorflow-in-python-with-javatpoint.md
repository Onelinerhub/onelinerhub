// plain

TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. It can be used with Python to build powerful machine learning models.

Using TensorFlow in Python with Javatpoint is simple. First, you need to import the TensorFlow library in your Python code.

```
import tensorflow as tf
```

Then, you can create a TensorFlow graph that defines the computation. For example, the following code creates a graph that adds two constants:

```
a = tf.constant(2)
b = tf.constant(3)
c = a + b

print(c)

# Output: tf.Tensor(5, shape=(), dtype=int32)
```

Finally, you can run the graph in a TensorFlow session. The following code runs the graph and prints the result:

```
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
print(sess.run(c))

# Output: 5
```
