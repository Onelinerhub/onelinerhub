# How do I load a pb model using TensorFlow in Python?
// plain

Loading a pb model using TensorFlow in Python is relatively simple. The following code block shows an example of how to do this:

```
# Import the TensorFlow library
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the model
model = tf.saved_model.load("my_model.pb")
```

The above code snippet imports the TensorFlow library and then loads the model from the file `my_model.pb`.

The code consists of two parts:

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow library.

2. `model = tf.saved_model.load("my_model.pb")`: This loads the model from the file `my_model.pb`.

For more information, please refer to the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/load).
