# How do I use dropout in TensorFlow with Python?
// plain

Dropout is a regularization technique used to reduce overfitting in neural networks. In TensorFlow, it can be implemented with the `tf.nn.dropout()` function.

## Example code

```
# Create a placeholder for the input
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 784])

# Define the dropout rate
keep_prob = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)

# Create a fully-connected layer with dropout
fc1 = tf.layers.dense(x, 256, activation=tf.nn.relu)
fc1_drop = tf.nn.dropout(fc1, keep_prob)

# Output layer
logits = tf.layers.dense(fc1_drop, 10)
```

The `tf.nn.dropout()` function takes two arguments: the input and the dropout rate. The dropout rate is a float value between 0 and 1 that determines the probability of dropping out a particular unit. In the example above, the `tf.nn.dropout()` function is applied to the fully-connected layer with a dropout rate of `keep_prob`.

The output of the example code is a logits tensor with a shape of `[None, 10]`.

## Code explanation

1. `x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 784])`: Creates a placeholder for the input.
2. `keep_prob = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)`: Defines the dropout rate.
3. `fc1 = tf.layers.dense(x, 256, activation=tf.nn.relu)`: Creates a fully-connected layer.
4. `fc1_drop = tf.nn.dropout(fc1, keep_prob)`: Applies the `tf.nn.dropout()` function to the fully-connected layer with the dropout rate specified by `keep_prob`.
5. `logits = tf.layers.dense(fc1_drop, 10)`: Creates the output layer.
