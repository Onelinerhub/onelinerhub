# How can I use Python and TensorFlow to create an online application?
// plain

Using Python and TensorFlow, you can create an online application that can be used to build and train machine learning models. For example, you can use TensorFlow to create a deep learning model that can be used to classify images or detect objects in images. You can then deploy this model as a web service that can be used by other applications and websites.

Here is an example of code that can be used to create a deep learning model using TensorFlow:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

This code will create a deep learning model with two hidden layers and an output layer. The model will be trained using the x_train and y_train data sets and evaluated using the x_test and y_test data sets.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed as a web service using TensorFlow Serving. This will allow other applications and websites to use the model to make predictions.

## Code explanation

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the TensorFlow library into the program.
2. `model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([...])`: This creates a deep learning model using the Keras API from TensorFlow.
3. `model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])`: This compiles the model with the specified optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
4. `model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)`: This trains the model using the x_train and y_train data sets for 5 epochs.
5. `model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)`: This evaluates the model using the x_test and y_test data sets.
