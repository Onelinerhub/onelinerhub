# How do I use Python and TensorFlow to create a face recognition system?
// plain

To create a face recognition system using Python and TensorFlow, we first need to install the relevant libraries. We can use `pip` to install TensorFlow and the `face_recognition` library.

```
pip install tensorflow
pip install face_recognition
```

Once the libraries are installed, we can use the `face_recognition` library to detect the faces in an image. To do this, we can use the `face_locations` function, which takes an image as an argument and returns a list of bounding boxes for each detected face in the image.

```
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

print(face_locations)
```

## Output example
 `[(121, 490, 246, 365), (258, 717, 383, 592)]`

We can then use a pre-trained deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), to extract features from the detected faces. We can use the `TensorFlow` library to create and train the CNN model.

Once the model is trained, we can use it to compare the features extracted from a detected face with a set of known faces. If the features match, we can then classify the face as belonging to a known person.
