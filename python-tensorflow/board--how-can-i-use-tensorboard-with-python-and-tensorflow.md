How can I use TensorBoard with Python and TensorFlow?

TensorBoard is a powerful visualization tool for visualizing the performance of your TensorFlow models. It is easy to use with Python and TensorFlow. To use TensorBoard, you first need to create a TensorFlow summary writer, which will write the data to be visualized to a log directory. The following example code shows how to do this:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a summary writer, add the 'graph' to the event file.
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(logdir='./logs', graph=tf.get_default_graph())
```

Once the summary writer is created, you can use the `add_summary()` method to add data to the log directory. For example, if you want to log the value of a TensorFlow variable, you can use the following code:

```
# Create a variable.
var = tf.Variable(0.0, name='var')

# Update the variable.
var.assign_add(1.0)

# Create a summary for the variable.
summary = tf.summary.scalar('var', var)

# Add the summary to the event file.
writer.add_summary(summary)
```

You can then visualize the data in TensorBoard by running the following command in the terminal:

```
tensorboard --logdir ./logs
```

The output of this command will be a URL, which you can open in your browser to view the TensorBoard visualization.
