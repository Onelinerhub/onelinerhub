# How do I use TensorFlow in Python?

TensorFlow is a powerful open source library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited and widely used for deep learning and machine learning applications. To use TensorFlow in Python, you will need to install the library first. You can install it using `pip install tensorflow`, or you can visit [TensorFlow's website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for more detailed instructions.

Once you have installed TensorFlow, you can start using it in your Python code. For example, you can create a simple TensorFlow program that adds two numbers:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create two constant nodes
a = tf.constant(2.0)
b = tf.constant(3.0)

# Add the two nodes
c = a + b

# Create a session to evaluate the graph
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(c)
    print(result)

# Output: 5.0
```

In the example above, we:

1. Imported the TensorFlow library as `tf`
2. Created two constant nodes `a` and `b` with values 2.0 and 3.0 respectively
3. Added the two nodes using the `+` operator
4. Created a session and ran the graph to evaluate the result
5. Printed the result, which was 5.0

With TensorFlow, you can create and execute more complex machine learning models, such as deep neural networks. For more information on using TensorFlow, please refer to its [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/).
