# How do I reshape a tensor in Python using TensorFlow?
// plain

Reshaping a tensor in Python using TensorFlow is a relatively simple process. To reshape a tensor, you can use the tf.reshape() function. This function takes a tensor as its first argument and a shape as its second argument. The shape argument is a tuple that specifies the desired shape of the output tensor.

For example, the following code reshapes a 2x3 tensor into a 3x2 tensor:
```
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, (3, 2))

print(reshaped_tensor)
```
## Output example

```
tf.Tensor(
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]], shape=(3, 2), dtype=int32)
```

The code consists of the following parts:
1. Importing the TensorFlow library as tf
2. Creating a 2x3 tensor
3. Reshaping the tensor using the tf.reshape() function
4. Printing the reshaped tensor
