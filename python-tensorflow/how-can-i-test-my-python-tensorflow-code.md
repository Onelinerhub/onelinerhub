# How can I test my Python TensorFlow code?
// plain

Testing Python TensorFlow code is important to ensure that the code is working as expected. The following steps can be taken to test the code:

1. Debugging: This can be done by setting breakpoints in the code and running it in a debugger. This will allow you to step through the code and inspect the values of the variables at each step.

2. Unit Testing: Unit testing is a way of testing individual parts of the code to make sure that they are working correctly. This can be done using the unittest module.

## Example code

```
import unittest

class TestTensorFlow(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_tf_code(self):
        # Test code here
        self.assertEqual(expected_result, actual_result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

3. Integration Testing: Integration testing is a way of testing how different parts of the code interact with each other. This can be done by writing test cases that test the whole system.

## Example code

```
import unittest

class TestTensorFlowIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_tf_code(self):
        # Test code here
        self.assertEqual(expected_result, actual_result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

4. Performance Testing: Performance testing is a way of testing how the code performs in terms of speed and memory usage. This can be done by measuring the time taken to execute the code and the amount of memory used.

5. Regression Testing: Regression testing is a way of testing the code to make sure that new changes have not introduced any bugs. This can be done by running the same tests that were run before the changes were made.

6. Automated Testing: Automated testing is a way of running tests automatically without any manual intervention. This can be done using tools such as Jenkins and Travis CI.

7. Manual Testing: Manual testing is a way of testing the code manually by running it and checking the results. This can be done by running the code and manually checking the results.
