# How do I fix the "module 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops' has no attribute '_tensorlike' " error?
// plain

The error `module 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops' has no attribute '_tensorlike'` occurs when using the TensorFlow library in Python.

The root cause of this error is that the version of TensorFlow installed is not compatible with the version of Python being used.

To fix this error, first check the version of Python you are using. You can do this by running the following command in a Python shell:
```
import sys
print(sys.version)
```
The output should look something like this:
```
3.7.4 (default, Aug 13 2019, 15:17:50)
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)]
```

Once you know the version of Python, you can then install the correct version of TensorFlow for that version of Python. You can find instructions for installing TensorFlow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

If you already have the correct version of TensorFlow installed, then the problem may be due to a mismatch between the version of TensorFlow you are using and the version of Python you are using. To fix this, you can try uninstalling and then reinstalling TensorFlow.

Finally, if you are still having problems, you may need to upgrade your version of Python to one that is compatible with the version of TensorFlow you are using. You can find instructions for upgrading Python [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).
