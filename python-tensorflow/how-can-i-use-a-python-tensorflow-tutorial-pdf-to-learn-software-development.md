Python TensorFlow tutorial PDFs are a great way to learn software development. To get started, it's important to understand the basics of Python programming, including variables, functions, and data types. Once these concepts are understood, you can move on to learning about the TensorFlow library and its functions.

For example, the following code block shows how to create a basic TensorFlow graph using the `tf.Graph()` function:
```
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a graph
g = tf.Graph()
```

The code above creates a basic graph object, which can then be used to construct a computational graph. Other TensorFlow functions can then be used to add nodes to the graph, as well as to perform various operations on the nodes.

To understand how to use TensorFlow more effectively, it's important to understand the different parts of the library. Here are some of the key parts of the library that you should understand:

- **tf.Graph()**: This function is used to create a graph object.
- **tf.Session()**: This function is used to create a session object, which manages the execution of a graph.
- **tf.placeholder()**: This function is used to create a placeholder node, which allows data to be fed into the graph.
- **tf.Variable()**: This function is used to create a variable node, which stores values that can be used in the graph.
- **tf.add()**: This function is used to add two nodes together.
- **tf.matmul()**: This function is used to perform matrix multiplication.

By understanding these parts of the TensorFlow library, you can begin to develop software that uses the library effectively. For further information, you can check out the official TensorFlow [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf).
