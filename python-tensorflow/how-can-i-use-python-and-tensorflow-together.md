# How can I use Python and TensorFlow together?
// plain

Python and TensorFlow can be used together to create powerful machine learning models. To use Python and TensorFlow together, you first need to install TensorFlow. Then, you can write Python code to create and train a model using TensorFlow. Here is an example of code that creates a simple linear regression model:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the feature columns
feature_columns = [tf.feature_column.numeric_column("x", shape=[1])]

# Create the model
model = tf.estimator.LinearRegressor(feature_columns=feature_columns)

# Train the model
model.train(input_fn=train_input_fn, steps=2000)
```

This code does the following:

1. Imports the TensorFlow library.
2. Defines the feature columns, which are the inputs to the model.
3. Creates the linear regression model.
4. Trains the model using the `train_input_fn` function.

You can find more information on using Python and TensorFlow together in the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/).
