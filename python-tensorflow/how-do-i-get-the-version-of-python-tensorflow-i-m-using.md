# How do I get the version of Python TensorFlow I'm using?
// plain

To get the version of Python TensorFlow you are using, you can use the following code block:

```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

This will output the version of TensorFlow you are currently using, e.g. `2.2.0`.

The code block consists of the following parts:

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This imports the tensorflow module as `tf`, so that you can access its functions and attributes.
2. `print(tf.__version__)`: This prints the version of TensorFlow you are currently using.
