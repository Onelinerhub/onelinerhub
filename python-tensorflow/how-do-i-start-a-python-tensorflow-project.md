# How do I start a Python TensorFlow project?
// plain

To start a Python TensorFlow project, you will need to install TensorFlow and the associated dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
$ pip install tensorflow
```

Once TensorFlow is installed, you can create a new Python file and import the TensorFlow library. For example:

```
import tensorflow as tf
```

Now you can create your TensorFlow graph. This involves creating nodes, or "ops", which represent mathematical operations. For example:

```
a = tf.constant(5.0)
b = tf.constant(6.0)
c = a * b
```

The last step is to create a session and run the graph. This will evaluate the graph and return the result of the operations. For example:

```
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(c))
```

## Output example

```
30.0
```

You can learn more about creating TensorFlow projects by reading the official [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).
