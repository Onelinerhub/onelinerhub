# How do I fix the "module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'python_io' error?
// plain

The error `module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'python_io'` is caused by trying to use a version of TensorFlow that is too old. The `python_io` attribute was introduced in TensorFlow 2.0, so any version prior to that will not have it.

The easiest way to fix this error is to upgrade to the latest version of TensorFlow. This can be done by running the following command:

```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

If you need to use an older version of TensorFlow, you can install it using the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow==1.15
```

## Code explanation

- `pip install --upgrade tensorflow`: this command will upgrade TensorFlow to the latest version
- `pip install tensorflow==1.15`: this command will install TensorFlow version 1.15
