# How can I generate a summary of my TensorFlow model in Python?
// plain

The TensorFlow model summary in Python can be generated using the `tf.summary` module.

The following example code can be used to generate a summary of a TensorFlow model:

```
# Create a summary writer
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs')

# Add summaries to the model
with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy, step=epoch)
    tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=epoch)
    tf.summary.image('input_image', input_image, step=epoch)

# Write the summaries to disk
writer.flush()
```

The above code will generate a summary of the TensorFlow model, which can be visualized using the TensorBoard.

The `tf.summary` module consists of the following components:

- `tf.summary.scalar()`: Used to log scalar values, such as accuracy and loss.
- `tf.summary.image()`: Used to log images, such as input images.
- `tf.summary.histogram()`: Used to log histograms, such as weights and biases.
- `tf.summary.text()`: Used to log text, such as hyperparameters.
