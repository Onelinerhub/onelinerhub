# How can I use TensorFlow with Python?
// plain

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library that can be used with Python to create and train deep learning models. It provides a variety of tools and libraries that allow users to create, train, and deploy deep learning models.

To use TensorFlow with Python, you need to install the TensorFlow library. You can install it using `pip`:

```
pip install tensorflow
```

Once the library is installed, you can import it into your Python code:

```
import tensorflow as tf
```

Using TensorFlow, you can create deep learning models by defining the model structure, compiling the model, and training the model. You can also use TensorFlow to evaluate the model and make predictions.

For example, the following code creates a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow:

```
# Create the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=[1])
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(x, y, epochs=1000)
```

The code above creates a simple linear regression model, compiles it, and trains it using the given data.

For more information on using TensorFlow with Python, you can refer to the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).
