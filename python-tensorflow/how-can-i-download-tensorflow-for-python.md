# How can I download TensorFlow for Python?
// plain

To download TensorFlow for Python, you can use the `pip` package manager. For example, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install tensorflow
```

This will download and install the latest version of TensorFlow for Python.

Alternatively, you can download the TensorFlow source code from the [TensorFlow GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) and build it yourself.

If you are using Anaconda, you can also install TensorFlow using the `conda` package manager. For example, you can run the following command:

```
conda install tensorflow
```

If you are using a different version of Python, you can also use the `virtualenv` package manager to create a virtual environment for TensorFlow.

You can also find pre-built binary packages for TensorFlow on the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

Finally, you can also use Docker to run TensorFlow. You can find instructions on how to do this on the [TensorFlow Docker page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker).
