# How do I upgrade my Python TensorFlow version?
// plain

Upgrading your Python TensorFlow version can be done in two ways:
1. Using `pip install`:
    ```
    pip install --upgrade tensorflow
    ```
2. Using `pip install` with a specific version:
    ```
    pip install tensorflow==2.2.0
    ```

This will upgrade your TensorFlow version to the latest version available or the specified version.

## Code explanation

1. `pip install` - command used to install packages
2. `--upgrade` - flag used to upgrade an existing package
3. `tensorflow` - name of the package to install/upgrade
4. `==` - operator used to specify an exact version
5. `2.2.0` - version number to install
