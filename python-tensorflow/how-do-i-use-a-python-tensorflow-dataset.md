# How do I use a Python TensorFlow dataset?
// plain

Using a Python TensorFlow dataset is a great way to quickly get started with machine learning. Here is an example of how to use a TensorFlow dataset:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)

# Iterate through the dataset
for x in dataset:
  # Process the data
  print(x)

# Output
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]
```

The code above demonstrates how to use a TensorFlow dataset. First, the dataset is imported using `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)`. Then, the dataset is iterated through using a `for` loop, and each element is processed. In this example, the data is simply printed.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: imports the TensorFlow library
2. `dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)`: loads the dataset
3. `for x in dataset`: iterates through the dataset
4. `print(x)`: processes the data

For more information on using TensorFlow datasets, see the [official documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset).
