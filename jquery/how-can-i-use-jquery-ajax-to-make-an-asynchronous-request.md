# How can I use jQuery AJAX to make an asynchronous request?
// plain

jQuery AJAX is a powerful tool for making asynchronous requests. It allows you to send and receive data from a server without having to reload the page. Here is an example of how to use jQuery AJAX to make an asynchronous request:

```
$.ajax({
  url: 'https://example.com/api/data',
  type: 'GET',
  success: function(response) {
    console.log(response);
  }
});
```

The `$.ajax()` function takes an object as an argument. This object contains various parameters such as `url`, `type` and `success`.

- `url` is the URL of the request.
- `type` is the type of request (GET, POST, etc).
- `success` is a callback function which will be executed when the request is successful.

In this example, we are making a GET request to an API endpoint and logging the response in the console.
