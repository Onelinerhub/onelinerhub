# How can I use jQuery to select elements with an XPath expression?
// plain

Using jQuery to select elements with an XPath expression is possible with the help of the `jQuery.find()` method. This method accepts an XPath expression as its argument, and returns a collection of elements that match the expression.

## Example code

```javascript
var elements = jQuery.find('//div[@class="myClass"]');
```

This code will return a collection of all `<div>` elements with the class `myClass`.

The code can be broken down into the following parts:

1. `jQuery.find()`: The jQuery method used to search for elements using an XPath expression.
2. `'//div[@class="myClass"]'`: The XPath expression used to locate elements. In this example, it is looking for `<div>` elements with the class `myClass`.
