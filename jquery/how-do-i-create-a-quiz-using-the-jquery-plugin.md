# How do I create a quiz using the jQuery plugin?
// plain

Creating a quiz using the jQuery plugin is fairly straightforward. The basic steps are as follows:

1. Include the jQuery library in the HTML document.
```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

2. Include the jQuery quiz plugin in the HTML document.
```
<script src="jquery.quiz-min.js"></script>
```

3. Create the HTML structure for the quiz.
```
<div id="quiz-container"></div>
```

4. Initialize the quiz plugin by calling the `quiz` method on the jQuery object and passing in the quiz data.
```
$('#quiz-container').quiz({
  questions: [
    {
      text: 'What is the capital of France?',
       'Paris'
    },
    {
      text: 'What is the capital of Germany?',
       'Berlin'
    }
  ]
});
```

5. Style the quiz with CSS as desired.

6. Add any additional functionality such as a scoring system or a way to submit the quiz.

7. Finally, test the quiz to make sure it works as expected.
