// plain

To delete an element using jQuery, you can use the `.remove()` method. This method removes the element from the DOM and all of its child nodes. Here is an example of how to use it:

```
$('#some-element').remove();
```

This code will remove the element with the ID of `some-element` from the DOM.

## Code explanation


1. `$('#some-element')`: This is a jQuery selector which selects the element with the ID of `some-element`.
2. `.remove()`: This is the jQuery method which removes the selected element from the DOM.
