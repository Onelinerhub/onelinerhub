How do I use jQuery query selectors?
// plain

Query selectors are used in jQuery to select HTML elements from the DOM (Document Object Model). jQuery selectors are similar to CSS selectors, so you can use any valid CSS selector in a jQuery selector.

For example, to select all `<p>` elements on a page with jQuery, you would use the following code:

```
$('p')
```

This code will select all `<p>` elements on the page.

The following list explains the parts of the code above:

- `$` - The jQuery function
- `('p')` - The selector, which is a CSS selector that selects all `<p>` elements

You can also use more complex selectors to select specific elements on a page. For example, the following code will select all `<p>` elements with a class of `example`:

```
$('p.example')
```

The following list explains the parts of the code above:

- `$` - The jQuery function
- `('p.example')` - The selector, which is a CSS selector that selects all `<p>` elements with a class of `example`

For more information about jQuery selectors, please refer to the [jQuery documentation](https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).
