# How do I use jQuery to zoom in or out on an element?
// plain

The jQuery library provides a few methods that can be used to zoom in or out on an element. The `.animate()` method can be used to animate the size of an element. The `.css()` method can be used to set the size of the element. The `.width()` and `.height()` methods can also be used to set the size of the element.

## Example code

```
$("#element").animate({
    width: "+=50px",
    height: "+=50px"
}, 500);
```

This example code will zoom in on the element with the ID of "element" by increasing its width and height by 50px over the course of 500 milliseconds.

Parts of the code:
- `$("#element")`: This selects the element with the ID of "element".
- `.animate({...})`: This is the animate method that is used to animate the size of the element.
- `width: "+=50px"`: This sets the width of the element to increase by 50px.
- `height: "+=50px"`: This sets the height of the element to increase by 50px.
- `500`: This is the duration of the animation in milliseconds.
