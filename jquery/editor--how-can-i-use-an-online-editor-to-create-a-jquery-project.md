How can I use an online editor to create a jQuery project?
// plain

An online editor can be used to create a jQuery project. For example, [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) is a popular online editor that supports jQuery. To create a project, you can start by creating a new Fiddle. You can then add your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to the respective panels. For example,

```
<div id="example">Hello World!</div>

<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("#example").click(function(){
    alert("Hello World!");
  });
});
</script>
```

When the code is executed, the alert "Hello World!" will be displayed when the div element with the id "example" is clicked.

You can also add external libraries to your project. For example, if you wanted to use jQuery UI, you can add a link to the jQuery UI library from the External Resources panel.

Once you have completed your project, you can share it by clicking the Share button. This will generate a unique URL that you can use to share your project with others.
