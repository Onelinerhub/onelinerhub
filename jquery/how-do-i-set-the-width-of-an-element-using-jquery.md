# How do I set the width of an element using jQuery?
// plain

Setting the width of an element using jQuery is a simple task that can be accomplished using the `width()` method. The `width()` method sets the width of the selected element in pixels.

For example, the following code block will set the width of the element with the ID `#myElement` to `200px`:

```
$('#myElement').width(200);
```

This code will not produce any output.

The code is made up of three parts:

1. `$('#myElement')` - This is a jQuery selector that selects the element with the ID `#myElement`.
2. `width()` - This is the jQuery method that is used to set the width of an element.
3. `200` - This is the width in pixels that will be set for the selected element.
