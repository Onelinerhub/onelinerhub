# How do I use jQuery to create a website according to the W3Schools standards?
// plain

jQuery is a JavaScript library that can be used to create websites according to W3Schools standards.

To use jQuery to create a website, you will need to include the jQuery library in your HTML document. This can be done by adding the following code to the <head> section of your HTML document:

```<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>```

Once the library is included, you can use jQuery functions to manipulate the elements on your page. For example, you can use the `$(document).ready()` function to execute a function when the page is loaded.

```
$(document).ready(function(){
  alert("The page is ready!");
});
```

## Output example
 `The page is ready!`

The code above will display an alert message when the page is loaded.

To use jQuery to create a website according to W3Schools standards, you should also use jQuery selectors to access and manipulate elements on the page. For example, you can use the `$('div')` selector to access all `<div>` elements on the page.

You can also use jQuery event handlers to respond to user events such as clicks, mouseover, and keypress. For example, you can use the `$('button').click()` function to execute a function when a button is clicked.

```
$('button').click(function(){
  alert("The button was clicked!");
});
```

## Output example
 `The button was clicked!`
