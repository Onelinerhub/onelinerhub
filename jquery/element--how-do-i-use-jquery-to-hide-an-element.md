How do I use jQuery to hide an element?
// plain

jQuery provides a simple way to hide an element using the `hide()` method. This method sets the `display` property of the element to `none`, which makes it invisible on the page.

To use the `hide()` method, you need to select the element you want to hide, then call the `hide()` method on it. For example:

```javascript
$('#myElement').hide();
```

This will hide the element with the ID of `myElement`.

## Code explanation


1. `$('#myElement')`: This is a jQuery selector that selects the element with the ID of `myElement`.
2. `hide()`: This is the jQuery method that hides the selected element.
3. `display`: This is the CSS property that is set to `none` when the `hide()` method is called.
