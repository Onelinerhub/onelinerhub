# How do I set the height of an element using jQuery?
// plain

The height of an element can be set using jQuery's `height()` method. The syntax for this method is `height(value)`, where `value` is either a number or a function.

For example, to set the height of an element with an ID of `myDiv` to `200px`, the following code can be used:

```
$('#myDiv').height(200);
```

The list of parts in the code above are:

* `$('#myDiv')` - This is a jQuery selector used to select the element with an ID of `myDiv`.
* `height(200)` - This is the `height()` method used to set the height of the element. The value `200` is passed as an argument to the method.

Alternatively, the `height()` method can also take a function as an argument. For example, to set the height of the element to twice its original height, the following code can be used:

```
$('#myDiv').height(function(index, height) {
  return height * 2;
});
```

The list of parts in the code above are:

* `$('#myDiv')` - This is a jQuery selector used to select the element with an ID of `myDiv`.
* `height(function(index, height) {...})` - This is the `height()` method used to set the height of the element. The function passed as an argument takes two arguments, `index` and `height`, and returns a value which is used to set the height of the element.
