// plain

jQuery and Bootstrap can be used together to create a website by leveraging the power of both libraries. By combining the two, developers can create dynamic, responsive websites with a variety of features.

For example, the following code block combines jQuery and Bootstrap to create a simple website:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This code block includes the following components:

1. HTML document structure: This code sets up the HTML document structure and includes the necessary meta tags.
2. Bootstrap CSS: This code links to the Bootstrap CSS library, which provides styling for the website.
3. jQuery library: This code links to the jQuery library, which provides the necessary JavaScript for the website.
4. Bootstrap JavaScript: This code links to the Bootstrap JavaScript library, which provides additional JavaScript for the website.
5. HTML body: This code sets up the HTML body with a container div and a welcome message.
