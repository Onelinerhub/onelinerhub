# How can I use jQuery to manipulate HTML elements?
// plain

jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that enables you to easily manipulate HTML elements. Here is an example of how to use jQuery to hide a div element:

```
<div id="myDiv">This is a div element</div>
<script>
$("#myDiv").hide();
</script>
```

This code will hide the div element with the id "myDiv".

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* `<div id="myDiv">This is a div element</div>` - This is the HTML element to be manipulated.

* `$("#myDiv")` - This is the jQuery selector used to select the element with the id "myDiv".

* `.hide()` - This is the jQuery function that will hide the element.
