# How do I use jQuery to change the z-index of an element?
// plain

To change the z-index of an element using jQuery, you can use the `css()` method. This method takes two parameters, the first being the CSS property you wish to change, and the second being the value you wish to set it to.

For example, to set the z-index of an element with the ID "example" to 10, you can use the following code:
```js
$('#example').css('z-index', 10);
```

This code will set the z-index of the element with the ID "example" to 10.

The parts of this code are as follows:
- `$('#example')` - This is a jQuery selector which selects the element with the ID "example".
- `css('z-index', 10)` - This is the `css()` method, which takes two parameters - the first being the CSS property you wish to change, and the second being the value you wish to set it to. In this case, we are setting the z-index to 10.
