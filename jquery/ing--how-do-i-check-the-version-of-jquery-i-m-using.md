How do I check the version of jQuery I'm using?
// plain

To check which version of jQuery you are using, you can use the `jQuery.fn.jquery` property. This property will return a string containing the version of jQuery you are using.

## Example code

```
console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery);
```

Example output:
```
3.5.1
```

The code above will print out the version of jQuery you are using in the console.

The code consists of two parts:

* `jQuery.fn.jquery`: This is the property that will return the version of jQuery you are using.
* `console.log`: This is a function that will print out the version of jQuery you are using in the console.

For more information, see the [jQuery Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.fn.jquery/).
