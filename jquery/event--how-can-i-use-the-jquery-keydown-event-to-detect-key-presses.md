How can I use the jQuery keydown event to detect key presses?
// plain

The jQuery keydown event can be used to detect key presses. To use it, you can bind the keydown event to a specific element or document object. The following example code shows how to bind the keydown event to the body element and print out the key code of the key pressed:

```
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("body").keydown(function(event){
    console.log("key code: " + event.keyCode);
  });
});
```

When a key is pressed, the key code of the key pressed will be printed out in the console. The key code is a numerical value that is associated with the key pressed.

## Code explanation

- `$(document).ready(function(){...})` - This is used to ensure that the code inside the function runs when the DOM is ready.
- `$("body").keydown(function(event){...})` - This binds the keydown event to the body element.
- `event.keyCode` - This is used to get the key code of the key pressed.
