# How do I use the jQuery document ready function?
// plain

The jQuery document ready function is a callback function that is triggered when the DOM is fully loaded. It is used to ensure that all DOM elements are available before executing any jQuery code.

## Example code

```
$(document).ready(function(){
    // jQuery code here
});
```

The code above will execute the jQuery code inside the function once the DOM is fully loaded.

## Code explanation


1. `$(document)` - This is a jQuery selector that selects the document object.
2. `.ready()` - This is a jQuery method that takes a callback function as an argument.
3. `function(){}` - This is a callback function that will be executed once the DOM is fully loaded.
4. `// jQuery code here` - This is the code that will be executed once the DOM is fully loaded.
