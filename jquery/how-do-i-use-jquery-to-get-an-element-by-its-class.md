# How do I use jQuery to get an element by its class?
// plain

Using jQuery to get an element by its class is simple. To do this, use the jQuery `.addClass()` method. This method takes two parameters: the class name and a function to be executed when the class is found.

```
$('.myclass').addClass(function(){
    // do something
});
```

The code above will look for an element with the class `myclass` and will execute the function when it is found.

The following is a list of parts of the code with a brief explanation:

- `$('.myclass')`: This is the jQuery selector which looks for an element with the class `myclass`.
- `.addClass()`: This is the jQuery method which adds a class to an element.
- `function(){ ... }`: This is the function which will be executed when the element with the class `myclass` is found.
