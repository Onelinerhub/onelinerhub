How do I use the jQuery change event?
// plain

The jQuery `change` event is triggered when the value of an element is changed. It can be used to detect when the value of an input field, select box, or textarea is changed. The syntax for using the `change` event is as follows:

```js
$(selector).change(function() {
  // code to be executed when the value of the element is changed
});
```

The following example code will alert the user when the value in the `input` field is changed:

```js
$('input').change(function() {
  alert('The value of the input field has changed!');
});
```

The code above consists of the following parts:

* `$('input')` - This is a jQuery selector that selects all `input` elements.
* `change(function()` - This is the jQuery `change` event, which will be triggered when the value of the `input` element is changed.
* `alert('The value of the input field has changed!')` - This is the code that will be executed when the `change` event is triggered.
