# How can I use the jQuery keyup event to detect user input?
// plain

The jQuery keyup event is used to detect user input in a web page. It is triggered when a key is released from the keyboard. This event can be used to detect user input in a text box, for example.

Below is an example of using the jQuery keyup event to detect user input in a text box:

```
$('#textbox').keyup(function(){
    alert('User input detected!');
});
```

When a user types something in the text box, the alert will be triggered.

## Code explanation

1. `$('#textbox')` - This is the selector for the text box.
2. `keyup` - This is the event that is being used.
3. `function(){ ... }` - This is the callback function that is triggered when the event is fired.
4. `alert('User input detected!')` - This is the code that is executed when the event is fired.
