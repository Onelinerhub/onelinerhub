# How do I add styles to an element using jQuery?
// plain

Adding styles to an element using jQuery is easy and straightforward. You can use the `css()` method to set the style of the element. Here's an example code block:
```javascript
$('#example').css({background-color: 'red', color: 'blue'});
```
This code will set the background-color of the element with the id of "example" to red, and the color of the text to blue.

The `css()` method takes an object as an argument. The object should have a list of the css properties you want to set and their respective values. Here's a list of the parts of the code above:

- `$('#example')` - This is a jQuery selector that selects the element with the id of "example".
- `css()` - This is the method used to set the style of the element.
- `{background-color: 'red', color: 'blue'}` - This is the object that contains the list of css properties and their values.
