# How do I unbind an event listener in jQuery?
// plain

To unbind an event listener in jQuery, you can use the `.off()` function. This function takes two parameters: the event type and the event listener. Here is an example:

```
$("#element").off("click", myFunction);
```

This example unbinds the `click` event listener `myFunction` from the element with the `id` attribute of `element`.

## Code explanation

1. `$("#element")`: This is a jQuery selector which selects the element with the `id` attribute of `element`.
2. `.off()`: This is the jQuery function used to unbind an event listener.
3. `"click"`: This is the event type which is being unbound.
4. `myFunction`: This is the event listener which is being unbound.
