How do I use jQuery style selectors?
// plain

A jQuery style selector is used to select HTML elements in a webpage. It works similarly to the CSS selectors, but with a few added features.

For example, you can select an element based on its ID, class, type, attribute, or even its relationship to other elements.

Here is an example of a jQuery selector:
```
$("#my-element")
```
This selector will select the element with the ID of "my-element".

You can also use multiple selectors to select multiple elements at once. For example:
```
$(".my-class, #my-element")
```
This selector will select all elements with the class "my-class" as well as the element with the ID of "my-element".

You can also use more advanced selectors to select elements based on their relationship to other elements. For example:
```
$("#my-element > p")
```
This selector will select all `<p>` elements that are direct children of the element with the ID of "my-element".
