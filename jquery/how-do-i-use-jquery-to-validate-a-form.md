# How do I use jQuery to validate a form?
// plain

jQuery provides a simple way to validate a form. To use jQuery to validate a form, you need to include the jQuery library in your HTML document and then use the `validate()` method.

## Example code

```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
<script>
$("#myForm").validate({
  rules: {
    fieldName: {
      required: true,
      minlength: 2
    }
  }
});
</script>
```

The `validate()` method takes an object containing the validation rules. Each rule consists of a `fieldName` and a set of `rules` for that field. In the example above, the `required` rule specifies that the field is mandatory, while the `minlength` rule specifies the minimum length of the field.

The `validate()` method will then validate the form when it is submitted. If any of the rules fail, an error message will be displayed.
