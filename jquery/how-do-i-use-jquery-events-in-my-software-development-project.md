# How do I use jQuery events in my software development project?
// plain

jQuery events are used to add interactivity to a web page. To use jQuery events in your software development project, you need to include the jQuery library in your project. Then, you can bind event handlers to elements on the page, which will be triggered when an event occurs. For example, the following code binds a click event handler to a button element:

```
$('#myButton').click(function() {
    alert('Button was clicked!');
});
```

When the button with the ID of `myButton` is clicked, the alert will be shown.

The parts of this code are:

- `$('#myButton')`: This selects the element with the ID of `myButton`.
- `click`: This specifies the event handler to bind.
- `function() {...}`: This is the callback function that will be called when the event occurs.

For more information about jQuery events, see the [jQuery documentation](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/).
