# How can I use jQuery to hide an element?
// plain

To use jQuery to hide an element, you can use the `.hide()` method. This method sets the `display` property of the element to `none`, which will cause the element to be hidden from view. The following example code block demonstrates how to use the `.hide()` method:

```
$("#myElement").hide();
```

This code will select the element with the ID of `myElement` and hide it. No output is produced by this code.

The code can be broken down as follows:

* `$("#myElement")`: This part of the code selects the element with the ID of `myElement`.
* `.hide()`: This part of the code calls the `.hide()` method to hide the element.

For more information on the `.hide()` method, see the [jQuery Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/hide/).
