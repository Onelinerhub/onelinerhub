# How can I parse JSON data using jQuery?
// plain

You can parse JSON data using jQuery by using the `$.getJSON()` method. This method takes a URL as a parameter, and then retrieves the JSON data from that URL. Here is an example of how to use it:

```
$.getJSON("https://example.com/data.json", function(data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

The output of this code would be the JSON data from the URL provided. The `data` parameter in the callback function is an object containing the JSON data.

You can then use the `$.each()` method to loop through the data and do whatever you want with it. Here is an example:

```
$.getJSON("https://example.com/data.json", function(data) {
    $.each(data, function(key, value) {
        console.log(key + ": " + value);
    });
});
```

In this example, the output would be each key and its associated value from the JSON data.

## Code explanation


- `$.getJSON(url, callback)`: This method takes a URL as a parameter and a callback function. The callback function will be called with the JSON data from the URL as a parameter.

- `$.each(object, callback)`: This method takes an object and a callback function. The callback function will be called with each key and its associated value from the object.
