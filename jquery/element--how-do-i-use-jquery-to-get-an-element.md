How do I use jQuery to get an element?
// plain

Using jQuery, you can get an element by using the `$()` function. This function takes a selector as an argument, which can be an HTML element, an ID, a class, or any other valid selector.

For example, to get an element with the ID of `my-element`, you would use the following code:

```js
var element = $('#my-element');
```

The above code will return a jQuery object containing the element with the ID of `my-element`. This object has access to various methods and properties that can be used to manipulate the element.

## Code explanation


- `$()`: This is the jQuery function that is used to get an element.
- `#my-element`: This is the selector that is passed to the `$()` function. In this case, it is selecting an element with the ID of `my-element`.
- `element`: This is the variable that is used to store the jQuery object that is returned by the `$()` function.
