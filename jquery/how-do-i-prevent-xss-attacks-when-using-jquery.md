# How do I prevent XSS attacks when using jQuery?
// plain

Preventing XSS attacks when using jQuery can be accomplished by using the jQuery Global Event Handler. This handler is triggered whenever an HTML element is added to the DOM and can be used to sanitize any user-inputted data before it is added to the page.

For example, the following code block will sanitize any user-inputted data before it is added to the page:

```
$(document).on('DOMNodeInserted', function(e) {
    var element = $(e.target);
    var value = element.val();
    if (value) {
        element.val(htmlEntities(value));
    }
});
```

This code will take any user-inputted data and convert it to HTML entities, preventing any malicious code from being executed.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `$(document).on('DOMNodeInserted', function(e) {` - This is the jQuery Global Event Handler which is triggered whenever an HTML element is added to the DOM.

2. `var element = $(e.target);` - This sets a variable called `element` to the element that was added to the DOM.

3. `var value = element.val();` - This sets a variable called `value` to the value of the element that was added to the DOM.

4. `if (value) {` - This checks if the element has a value.

5. `element.val(htmlEntities(value));` - This takes the value of the element and converts it to HTML entities, preventing any malicious code from being executed.

6. `});` - This closes the jQuery Global Event Handler.
