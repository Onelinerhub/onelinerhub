# How do I use the jQuery YTPlayer plugin?
// plain

The jQuery YTPlayer plugin is a jQuery plugin that allows you to easily embed YouTube videos in your web page.

To use the plugin, you need to include the jQuery library and the jQuery YTPlayer plugin in your web page:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.mb.YTPlayer.min.js"></script>
```

Then you can use the `.YTPlayer()` method to initialize the plugin on the desired element:

```
$('.player').YTPlayer();
```

You can also specify options for the plugin, such as the video ID, the width and height of the video, and more:

```
$('.player').YTPlayer({
  videoId: 'bHQqvYy5KYo',
  width: '640',
  height: '360'
});
```

The plugin also provides a few methods for controlling the video, such as `playVideo()` and `pauseVideo()`:

```
$('.player').YTPlayer('playVideo');
$('.player').YTPlayer('pauseVideo');
```

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/pupunzi/jquery.mb.YTPlayer/wiki).
