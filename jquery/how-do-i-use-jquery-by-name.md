jQuery by name is a jQuery library that allows you to write code that is more concise and easier to debug. It provides a number of useful features such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and AJAX.

To use jQuery by name, you must first include the jQuery library in your HTML page. This can be done by adding the following line of code to the <head> section of your HTML page:
```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
```

Once the jQuery library is included in your page, you can start using jQuery functions by calling the jQuery function with the name of the element you want to manipulate. For example, the following code will select all <p> elements on the page and add a class of 'highlighted' to them:
```
$('p').addClass('highlighted');
```

In this example, the `$()` function is used to select all <p> elements on the page. The `addClass()` function is then used to add a class of 'highlighted' to the selected elements.

You can also use jQuery to perform AJAX requests. The following example shows how to make an AJAX request to a web service and display the response in the browser:
```
$.get('https://example.com/api/data', function(response) {
  $('#result').html(response);
});
```

In this example, the `$.get()` function is used to make an AJAX request to the web service at `https://example.com/api/data`. The response from the web service is then passed as an argument to the callback function, which sets the HTML of the element with the ID 'result' to the response.

These are just a few examples of how to use jQuery by name. For more information on jQuery, you can check out the official documentation at https://api.jquery.com/.
