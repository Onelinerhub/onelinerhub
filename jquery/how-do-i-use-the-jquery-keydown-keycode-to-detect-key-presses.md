# How do I use the jQuery keydown keycode to detect key presses?
// plain

The jQuery keydown keycode is used to detect key presses on a webpage. It is used to detect when a specific key is pressed and to determine the keycode of the key that was pressed.

## Example code

```
$(document).keydown(function(e) {
    console.log(e.keyCode);
});
```

This code will log the keycode of the key that is pressed in the console.

## Code explanation

- $(document).keydown(function(e) - This is the jQuery keydown function. It takes a function as an argument that will be called when a key is pressed.
- console.log(e.keyCode) - This is the code that will be executed when a key is pressed. It logs the keycode of the key that was pressed.
