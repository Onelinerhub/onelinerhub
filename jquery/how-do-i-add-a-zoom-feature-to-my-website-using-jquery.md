# How do I add a zoom feature to my website using jQuery?
// plain

Adding a zoom feature to a website using jQuery is a relatively simple process. To begin, you must include the jQuery library in the HTML page. This can be done by adding the following code:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

Next, you must write a jQuery script that will add the zoom feature. This can be done by using the .zoom() method, which allows the user to zoom in and out of an element on the page. An example of this code is shown below:

```
$("#zoom_element").zoom();
```

The script can be further modified to add additional features, such as setting the zoom level, enabling and disabling the zoom feature, and so on.

## Code explanation


* `$("#zoom_element")` - This is a jQuery selector used to select the element with an ID of "zoom_element".
* `.zoom()` - This is the jQuery method used to enable the zoom feature.
