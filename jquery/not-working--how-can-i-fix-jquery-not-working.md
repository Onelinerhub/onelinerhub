How can I fix jquery not working?
// plain

The first step to fixing jQuery not working is to make sure that you have included the jQuery library in your HTML page. This can be done by adding a `<script>` tag to the `<head>` of your HTML page, like so:

```
<head>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

Next, you should check if jQuery is working by running a simple jQuery command, such as `$(document).ready()` in the console. If it returns `true`, then jQuery is working. If it returns `false`, then there is likely a problem with your jQuery library.

You should also make sure that you are using the correct version of jQuery for the code you are writing. Different versions of jQuery may have different syntax and features, and using an incorrect version can cause errors.

Finally, you should check for any syntax errors in your code. Common errors include typos, missing semicolons, and incorrect variable names.

To help debug your code, you can use the developer tools in your browser. This will show you any errors in your code, so you can quickly identify and fix them.
