# How do I use jQuery to make an element draggable?
// plain

Using jQuery to make an element draggable is fairly straightforward. The following example code will create a draggable <div> element:

```
<div id="myDiv">Drag me!</div>

<script>
  $( "#myDiv" ).draggable();
</script>
```

This code will make the <div> element with the id of "myDiv" draggable.

The code is broken down as follows:

1. The HTML element to be made draggable, in this case a <div> element with the id of "myDiv".
2. The jQuery draggable() method, which will make the element draggable.

For more information, see the [jQuery UI draggable documentation](https://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/).
