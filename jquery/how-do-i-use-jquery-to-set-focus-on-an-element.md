# How do I use jQuery to set focus on an element?
// plain

To set focus on an element using jQuery, you can use the `.focus()` method. This method triggers the `focus` event, or attaches a function to run when a `focus` event occurs.

## Example code

```
$("#input-field").focus();
```

The code above sets focus on the element with an ID of `input-field`.

The code consists of three parts:

1. `$("#input-field")` - This part selects the element with the ID of `input-field`.
2. `.focus()` - This part triggers the focus event on the selected element.
3. `;` - This part ends the statement.
