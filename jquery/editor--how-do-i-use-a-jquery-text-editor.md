How do I use a jQuery text editor?
// plain

A jQuery text editor is a type of web-based text editor that uses the jQuery JavaScript library to provide users with a range of features. To use a jQuery text editor, you need to include the jQuery library in your HTML page, and then create an instance of the editor by calling the `.textEditor()` method on a jQuery object.

Here is an example of how to create a text editor using jQuery:

```javascript
$('#myTextEditor').textEditor();
```

This code will create a text editor with the ID of `myTextEditor`.

## Code explanation


- `$('#myTextEditor')`: This is a jQuery object that selects the element with the ID of `myTextEditor`.
- `.textEditor()`: This is the method used to create an instance of the text editor.
