# How do I use jQuery UI to create a dynamic user interface?
// plain

jQuery UI is a great tool for creating dynamic user interfaces. It provides a wide variety of components and widgets to help you create complex user interfaces. Here is an example of how to use jQuery UI to create a dynamic user interface:

```
$(function() {
  $( "#accordion" ).accordion();
});
```

This code will create an accordion widget with collapsible content sections. The code consists of the following parts:

1. `$(function() {`: This is the document ready function, which runs the code inside the function when the page has finished loading.
2. `$( "#accordion" )`: This is the selector for the element with the id of "accordion".
3. `accordion()`: This is the jQuery UI accordion widget, which will create the accordion.

You can find more information about jQuery UI and its components on the [jQuery UI website](https://jqueryui.com/).
