# How do I use jQuery JS?
// plain

jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to use JavaScript on your website. It simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.

To use jQuery, you need to include the jQuery library in your HTML document, like this:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

You can then use jQuery in your code by selecting an element in the DOM and performing an action on it, like this:

```
$('#someElement').hide();
```

This will hide the element with the ID of `someElement`.

You can also use jQuery to bind event handlers, like this:

```
$('#someElement').click(function() {
  console.log('The element was clicked!');
});
```

This will log a message to the console when the element with the ID of `someElement` is clicked.

You can also use jQuery to make Ajax requests, like this:

```
$.get('/some/url', function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

This will make a GET request to `/some/url` and log the response data to the console.
