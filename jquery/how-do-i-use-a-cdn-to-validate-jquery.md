# How do I use a CDN to validate jQuery?
// plain

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a great way to validate jQuery, as it ensures that the code is up-to-date and secure. Here is an example of how to use a CDN to validate jQuery:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

This code block will include the latest version of jQuery from the Google CDN. This ensures that the code is up-to-date and secure.

1. `<script>` - This is an HTML tag that is used to include external scripts.
2. `src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"` - This is the URL of the jQuery script that is being included.
3. `</script>` - This is the closing HTML tag that is used to end the script.

By using the code above, you can easily validate jQuery with a CDN.
