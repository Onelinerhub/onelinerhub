# How can I use jQuery JS to achieve my desired result?
// plain

jQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that can be used to achieve a wide variety of desired results. To use jQuery, you must first include the jQuery library in your HTML document. This can be done by adding the following code to the <head> section of your HTML document:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

Once the library is included, you can use the jQuery functions to achieve your desired result. For example, if you want to make a div element with the id of "myDiv" fade out when you click on it, you can use the following code:

```
$("#myDiv").click(function(){
    $(this).fadeOut();
});
```

This code will cause the div with the id of "myDiv" to fade out when it is clicked. Other jQuery functions can be used to achieve a variety of results, such as manipulating the DOM, making AJAX calls, and more.

Parts of this code:

* `$("#myDiv")` - This code selects the element with the id of "myDiv".
* `.click(function(){...})` - This code adds an event listener to the element that will fire when it is clicked.
* `$(this).fadeOut()` - This code causes the element to fade out.
