**Fixing jQuery not working**

1. Check if the jQuery library is properly loaded in the HTML page. To do this, open the page in the browser and view the source code. Look for a `<script>` tag with `src` attribute pointing to the jQuery library. If it is not present, add the following code to the `<head>` section of the HTML page:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

2. Check if the jQuery code is executed after the page is loaded. To do this, add the following code to the `<body>` section of the HTML page:

```html
<script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        console.log("jQuery is ready!");
    });
</script>
```

If the code executes successfully, the following output will be displayed in the browser console:

```
jQuery is ready!
```

3. Check if the jQuery code is properly written. Make sure the selectors used in the code are valid and the syntax is correct.

4. Check if any other JavaScript libraries are conflicting with jQuery. To do this, try disabling other libraries and see if the jQuery code works.

5. Check if the jQuery version used is compatible with the browser version.

6. Check the browser console for any errors.

7. If all else fails, try using a different version of jQuery.
