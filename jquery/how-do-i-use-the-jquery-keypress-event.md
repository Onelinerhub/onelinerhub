# How do I use the jQuery keypress event?
// plain

The jQuery `keypress` event is used to detect when a key is pressed on the keyboard. This event can be used to trigger a function when a user presses a key.

## Example code

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $(document).keypress(function(e){
        alert("Key pressed: " + e.which);
    });
});
```

## Output example

```
Key pressed: <keycode>
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `$(document).ready()`: This ensures that the code is executed after the DOM is ready.
2. `$(document).keypress()`: This is the jQuery keypress event that is triggered when a key is pressed.
3. `e`: This is the event object that contains information about the key that was pressed.
4. `e.which`: This is the keycode of the key that was pressed.
5. `alert()`: This is used to display a message when the keypress event is triggered.
