# How do I use jQuery to add a class to an element?
// plain

To add a class to an element using jQuery, you can use the `addClass()` method. This method takes a single argument, which is the name of the class to be added. Here is an example code block:

```
$('#myElement').addClass('myClass');
```

This code adds the class `myClass` to the element with the ID of `myElement`.

The code is composed of the following parts:

1. `$('#myElement')`: This is a jQuery selector which selects the element with the ID of `myElement`.
2. `.addClass('myClass')`: This is the `addClass()` method which adds the class `myClass` to the selected element.
