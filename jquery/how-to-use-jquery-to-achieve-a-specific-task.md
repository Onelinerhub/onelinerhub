# How to use jQuery to achieve a specific task?
// plain

jQuery is a library of JavaScript functions that provides a number of useful features for web developers. To use jQuery to achieve a specific task, you will need to include the jQuery library in your HTML page, and then use the jQuery functions to manipulate the elements on the page.

For example, to add a class to an element on the page, you can use the `addClass()` method:

```javascript
$('#myElement').addClass('myClass');
```

This will add the class `myClass` to the element with the ID `myElement`.

The following list contains the main parts of the code and their explanations:

- `$('#myElement')` - This is a jQuery selector, which selects the element with the ID `myElement`.
- `addClass('myClass')` - This is the `addClass()` method, which adds the class `myClass` to the selected element.
