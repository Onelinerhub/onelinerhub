# How can I use jQuery to parse a JSON object?
// plain

jQuery can be used to parse a JSON object with the `$.getJSON()` method. This method takes a URL as an argument and returns a JavaScript object. Here is an example of how to use it:

```
$.getJSON("example.json", function(json) {
    console.log(json);
});
```

The output of this code would be the contents of the `example.json` file.

The code is broken down into the following parts:

1. `$.getJSON()`: This is the jQuery method used to retrieve a JSON object from a URL.
2. `example.json`: This is the URL of the JSON file that will be retrieved.
3. `function(json)`: This is the callback function that will be called once the JSON object is retrieved.
4. `console.log(json)`: This is the code that will be executed once the JSON object is retrieved. It will log the contents of the JSON object to the console.

For more information, see the [jQuery documentation](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/) for `$.getJSON()`.
