# How do I use the jQuery library?
// plain

The jQuery library is a powerful JavaScript library that makes it easy to add dynamic functionality to webpages. To use the jQuery library, you need to include a reference to the jQuery library in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

Once the jQuery library is included, you can use the jQuery functions to manipulate the DOM elements of your webpage. For example, you can use the `.css()` function to change the style of an element:

```javascript
$('#myElement').css('background-color', 'red');
```

This code will set the background color of the element with the `id` of `myElement` to red.

You can also use jQuery to attach event handlers to elements. For example, you can use the `.click()` function to attach a click handler to an element:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  alert('You clicked the button!');
});
```

This code will display an alert message when the element with the `id` of `myButton` is clicked.
