# How can I use jQuery to store data in localStorage?
// plain

jQuery can be used to store data in localStorage using the `.data()` method. This method will store data in the browser's local storage, which allows the data to persist after the page is refreshed.

```
// Store data in localStorage
$('#myElement').data('myData', {name: 'John', age: 30});

// Retrieve data from localStorage
var myData = $('#myElement').data('myData');
console.log(myData);
// Output: {name: 'John', age: 30}
```

The above code snippet stores an object containing the name and age of a person in localStorage, and then retrieves the data from localStorage.

The code is composed of the following parts:
1. `$('#myElement').data('myData', {name: 'John', age: 30});` This line stores an object containing the name and age of the person in localStorage.
2. `var myData = $('#myElement').data('myData');` This line retrieves the data from localStorage and stores it in a variable.
3. `console.log(myData);` This line logs the data stored in the variable to the console.
