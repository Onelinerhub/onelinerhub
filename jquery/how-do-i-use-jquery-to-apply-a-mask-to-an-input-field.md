# How do I use jQuery to apply a mask to an input field?
// plain

Using jQuery to apply a mask to an input field is a great way to ensure that the user is entering the correct data. Here is an example of how to do it:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("#input-field").mask("00/00/0000");
});
```

This code will apply a mask to the element with the id of "input-field" that will require the user to enter the date in the format of "MM/DD/YYYY".

The code is composed of the following parts:

1. `$(document).ready(function(){` - This line will make sure that the code is executed only after the DOM is loaded.

2. `$("#input-field")` - This line will select the element with the id of "input-field".

3. `.mask("00/00/0000")` - This line will apply a mask to the selected element that will require the user to enter the date in the format of "MM/DD/YYYY".
