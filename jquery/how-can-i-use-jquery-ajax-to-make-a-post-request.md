# How can I use jQuery AJAX to make a POST request?
// plain

jQuery AJAX is a powerful tool for making asynchronous requests to the server. It can be used to make a POST request to the server. Here is an example of how to do it:

```
$.ajax({
  type: "POST",
  url: "url_to_post_to",
  data: {
    name: "John",
    age: 25
  },
  success: function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  }
});
```

This code will make a POST request to the URL specified in `url`, with the data `name` and `age` specified in the `data` parameter. The `success` function will be called when the request is successful, and the response data will be passed to it.

The parts of the code are:

- `type`: specifies the type of request, in this case `POST`
- `url`: the URL to send the request to
- `data`: an object containing the data to be sent in the request
- `success`: a function to be called when the request is successful
