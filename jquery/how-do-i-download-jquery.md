# How do I download jQuery?
// plain

1. To download jQuery, you first need to visit the [jQuery website](https://jquery.com/download/).
2. On the jQuery website, you will find a download button located near the top of the page.
3. Clicking this button will provide you with a few different options for downloading jQuery.
4. You can either download the uncompressed version or the compressed version. The compressed version is smaller and faster, so it is usually the better option.
5. Once you have chosen the version you want to download, you can copy the code from the website and paste it into your HTML document. For example:
```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
```
6. You can also add the `defer` attribute to the script tag to ensure that the script is executed after the page has loaded:
```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js" defer></script>
```
7. Once you have added the script tag to your HTML document, jQuery will be downloaded and ready to use.
