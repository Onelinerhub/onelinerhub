# How do I select the first child element using jQuery?
// plain

The first child element of an element can be selected using jQuery with the `:first-child` selector.

## Example code

```
$('p:first-child')
```

This will select the first `<p>` element inside the parent element.

The code can be broken down into the following parts:

- `$('`: This is the jQuery selector function.
- `p`: This is the element type that will be selected.
- `:first-child`: This is the selector used to select the first child element.
- `')`: This is the closing parenthesis of the selector function.
