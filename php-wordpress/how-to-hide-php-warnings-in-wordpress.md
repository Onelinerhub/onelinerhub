# How to hide PHP warnings in WordPress?
// plain

To hide PHP warnings in WordPress, you can use the `error_reporting` function. This function allows you to specify which types of errors should be reported. For example, to hide all warnings, you can use the following code:

```
error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_WARNING);
```

This code will set the error reporting level to all errors except warnings.

Parts of the code:
- `error_reporting`: This is the function used to set the error reporting level.
- `E_ALL`: This is a constant that represents all errors.
- `~E_WARNING`: This is a constant that represents warnings.
- `&`: This is the bitwise AND operator, which is used to combine the two constants.
