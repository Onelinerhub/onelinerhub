// plain

Creating a snippet in WordPress using PHP is a great way to add custom functionality to your website. To create a snippet, you need to create a PHP file and add the following code:

```
<?php
// Your code goes here
?>
```

## Code explanation


1. `<?php` - This is the opening tag for the PHP code.
2. `// Your code goes here` - This is where you add your custom code.
3. `?>` - This is the closing tag for the PHP code.

Once you have added your code, you can save the file and upload it to your WordPress installation. You can then use the snippet in your WordPress theme or plugin.
