How do I create a Python Scipy worksheet?

Creating a Python Scipy worksheet is a great way to learn and practice scientific computing in Python. To create a Scipy worksheet, you will need to install the Scipy package and its dependencies.

Once you have installed Scipy, you can create a Scipy worksheet by importing the SciPy library and its submodules. For example, you could create a worksheet with the following code:

```
import scipy as sp
from scipy import linalg
```

This code imports the SciPy library and its submodule `linalg`, which contains linear algebra functions.

You can then use the functions in the SciPy library to perform calculations. For example, you can calculate the determinant of a matrix using the `det` function from the `linalg` submodule:

```
A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
detA = linalg.det(A)
print(detA)

# Output: -2.0
```

The code above creates a 2x2 matrix, `A`, and then calculates its determinant using the `det` function. The output of the code is `-2.0`.

To learn more about the SciPy library and its functions, you can read the [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html). You can also find many tutorials and examples online.
