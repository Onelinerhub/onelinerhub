# How to use Python, XML-RPC, and NumPy together?
// plain

Python, XML-RPC, and NumPy can be used together to create powerful data analysis applications.

XML-RPC is an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol that allows two computers to communicate with each other over the internet. It can be used to send and receive data from a remote server, allowing a program to access data from a remote location.

NumPy is a library for scientific computing in Python. It provides powerful data structures and algorithms for manipulating and analyzing data.

In order to use Python, XML-RPC, and NumPy together, you need to first install the necessary libraries. This can be done using the pip command:

```
pip install xmlrpc numpy
```

Once the libraries are installed, you can use them to write a program that connects to a remote server using XML-RPC, downloads the data from the server, and then uses NumPy to analyze the data.

For example, the following code connects to a server, downloads a dataset, and then uses NumPy to calculate the mean of the data:

```
import xmlrpc.client
import numpy as np

# Connect to the server
server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://example.com/rpc")

# Download the dataset
data = server.get_data()

# Calculate the mean
mean = np.mean(data)

print(mean)
```

## Output example

```
3.14
```

Parts of the code explained:
- `import xmlrpc.client`: Imports the xmlrpc library which provides the functionality for connecting to a remote server using XML-RPC.
- `import numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library which provides powerful data structures and algorithms for manipulating and analyzing data.
- `server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://example.com/rpc")`: Connects to a server using XML-RPC.
- `data = server.get_data()`: Downloads the dataset from the server.
- `mean = np.mean(data)`: Calculates the mean of the dataset using NumPy.
- `print(mean)`: Prints the result.
