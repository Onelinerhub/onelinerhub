# How can I use Python Scipy to convert between different units of measurement?
// plain

Python Scipy provides a module for unit conversions called `pint`. To use it, you need to import the module:

```
import pint
```

Once imported, you can create a `UnitRegistry` object:

```
ureg = pint.UnitRegistry()
```

This object can then be used to convert between different units of measurement. For example, to convert from meters to feet you can use the following code:

```
meters = 10
feet = meters * ureg.meter.to(ureg.feet)
print(feet)
```

## Output example

```
32.808398950131235 foot
```

The code is composed of the following parts:

1. `meters = 10` - This creates a variable `meters` and assigns it a value of 10.
2. `feet = meters * ureg.meter.to(ureg.feet)` - This multiplies the value of `meters` by the conversion factor from meters to feet.
3. `print(feet)` - This prints the value of `feet` to the console.
