# How do I calculate the average of a numpy array in Python?
// plain

To calculate the average of a numpy array in Python, you can use the `mean()` function. This function takes in an array as an argument and returns the average of all the values in the array. The following example code shows how to use the `mean()` function to calculate the average of a numpy array.

```
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Calculate the average
average = np.mean(a)

# Print the average
print(average)

# Output
3.0
```

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. Importing the numpy library as `np` - This allows us to access the `mean()` function.
2. Creating a numpy array - This is the array whose average we want to calculate.
3. Calculating the average - This is done by calling the `mean()` function and passing in the array as an argument.
4. Printing the average - This prints the average of the array.
