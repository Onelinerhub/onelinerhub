# How do I use the Newton optimization algorithm in Python with SciPy?
// plain

The Newton optimization algorithm is a numerical method used to find the minimum of a function. It is available in Python through the SciPy library. To use it, the following code can be used:

```
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def func(x):
   return x**2 + 10*np.sin(x)

res = minimize(func, x0=0, method='Newton-CG')
print(res.x)
```

This code will produce the following output:
```
[-1.30644012]
```

The code consists of the following parts:
1. An import of the `minimize` function from the `scipy.optimize` module.
2. The definition of a function `func` that takes a single argument `x` and returns the value of the function to be minimized.
3. The call to the `minimize` function with the function to be minimized, the initial guess for the minimum (`x0`) and the optimization method (`Newton-CG`).
4. The printing of the result, which is the value of `x` that minimizes the function.

For more information on the Newton optimization algorithm, see the [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html).
