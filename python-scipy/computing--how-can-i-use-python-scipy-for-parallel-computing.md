How can I use Python Scipy for parallel computing?
// plain

Python Scipy can be used for parallel computing by utilizing the multiprocessing module. This module allows for the spawning of multiple processes, which can be used to run computations in parallel. For example, the following code will run a function in parallel using 4 processes:

```
import multiprocessing

def some_function(args):
    # Do some computation
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(4)
    results = pool.map(some_function, args_list)
```

This code will spawn 4 processes, each running the `some_function` function with the arguments in `args_list`. The results of the computations are then collected in the `results` list.

The multiprocessing module also provides other methods to run computations in parallel, such as the `apply_async` and `map_async` methods.

The following list contains parts of the code above with a brief explanation:
- `import multiprocessing`: imports the multiprocessing module, which provides the necessary tools for parallel computing
- `def some_function(args):`: defines the function to be run in parallel
- `pool = multiprocessing.Pool(4)`: creates a pool of 4 processes
- `results = pool.map(some_function, args_list)`: runs the `some_function` function in parallel with the arguments in `args_list`, and stores the results in the `results` list
