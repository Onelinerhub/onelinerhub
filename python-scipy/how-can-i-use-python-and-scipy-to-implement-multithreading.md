# How can I use Python and SciPy to implement multithreading?
// plain

Python and SciPy can be used to implement multithreading. The threading module can be used to create threads, and the multiprocessing module can be used to manage the threads.

## Example code

```
import threading

def thread_function():
    print("Thread function")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function)
    thread.start()
    thread.join()
    print("Thread finished")
```
## Output example

```
Thread function
Thread finished
```

The code above creates a thread, starts it, and waits for the thread to finish. The thread_function will be executed in the thread, and when it is done, the main thread will print "Thread finished".

## Code explanation

* import threading - imports the threading module
* def thread_function(): - defines the thread function that will be executed in the thread
* thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function) - creates a thread, with the thread_function as the target
* thread.start() - starts the thread
* thread.join() - waits for the thread to finish
* print("Thread finished") - prints "Thread finished" when the thread is done
