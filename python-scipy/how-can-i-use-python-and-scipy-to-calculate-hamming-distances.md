# How can I use Python and SciPy to calculate Hamming distances?
// plain

To calculate Hamming distances in Python and SciPy, the `scipy.spatial.distance.hamming` function can be used. This function takes two vectors as input and returns the Hamming distance between them as output.

## Example code

```
from scipy.spatial import distance

vector1 = [1, 0, 0]
vector2 = [1, 1, 0]

hamming_distance = distance.hamming(vector1, vector2)

print(hamming_distance)
```

## Output example

```
0.3333333333333333
```

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. Importing the `distance` module from the `scipy.spatial` package, which contains the `hamming` function used to calculate the Hamming distance.

2. Declaring two vectors, `vector1` and `vector2`, which will be used as input for the `hamming` function.

3. Calling the `hamming` function, passing the two vectors as arguments, and assigning the result to the `hamming_distance` variable.

4. Printing the result of the `hamming_distance` variable.
