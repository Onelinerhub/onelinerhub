# How can I use Python and Scipy to implement a genetic algorithm?
// plain

A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm based on the principles of natural selection and genetics. It can be used to solve optimization problems by mimicking the process of natural selection.

Using Python and Scipy, you can implement a GA by following these steps:

1. Generate an initial population of solutions.
2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution in the population.
3. Select the fittest solutions for reproduction.
4. Apply genetic operators such as crossover and mutation to generate new solutions.
5. Evaluate the new solutions and repeat steps 3-5 until a satisfactory solution is found.

## Example code

```
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define objective function
def objective(x):
    return np.sum(x**2)

# Generate initial population
population_size = 10
population = np.random.rand(population_size, 2)

# Evaluate fitness
fitness = np.apply_along_axis(objective, 1, population)

# Select fittest solutions
fittest_indices = np.argsort(fitness)[:2]
fittest = population[fittest_indices]

# Apply genetic operators
offspring = np.empty_like(fittest)
offspring[0] = fittest[0] + 0.1*(fittest[1] - fittest[0])
offspring[1] = fittest[1] + 0.1*(fittest[0] - fittest[1])

# Evaluate new solutions
fitness = np.apply_along_axis(objective, 1, offspring)
```
