# How do I use Python Scipy constants in my software development project?
// plain

Scipy constants can be used in software development projects to access a wide range of mathematical and physical constants. To use Scipy constants in a project, the following steps should be taken:

1. Install Scipy: ```pip install scipy```
2. Import the constants module: ```from scipy import constants```
3. Access the constants: ```print(constants.c)``` Output: 299792458.0
4. Use the constants in calculations: ```distance = speed * time```

The constants module contains many useful constants such as the speed of light, the gravitational constant, the Boltzmann constant, the Avogadro constant, and many more.
