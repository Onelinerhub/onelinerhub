# How can I use Python and SciPy to solve a linear programming problem?
// plain

Python and SciPy can be used to solve linear programming problems using the ```scipy.optimize``` module. This module contains a variety of functions for minimizing and maximizing objectives with constraints. For example, the ```scipy.optimize.linprog``` function can be used to solve a linear programming problem.

For example, the following code block solves a linear programming problem with two variables and two constraints:

```
import scipy.optimize as opt

# Objective function
c = [1, 4]

# Constraints
A = [[3, 2], [2, 5]]
b = [15, 20]

# Bounds
x1_bounds = (0, None)
x2_bounds = (0, None)

res = opt.linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(x1_bounds, x2_bounds))

print(res)
```

The output of this code is:

```
fun: -14.000000000000007
message: 'Optimization terminated successfully.'
nit: 2
slack: array([0., 0.])
status: 0
success: True
x: array([2., 6.])
```

The parts of this code are:

- ```import scipy.optimize as opt```: imports the SciPy optimize module.
- ```c = [1, 4]```: defines the objective function.
- ```A = [[3, 2], [2, 5]]```: defines the constraints.
- ```b = [15, 20]```: defines the constraints.
- ```x1_bounds = (0, None)``` and ```x2_bounds = (0, None)```: defines the bounds for the variables.
- ```res = opt.linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(x1_bounds, x2_bounds))```: solves the linear programming problem.
- ```print(res)```: prints the result of the optimization.
