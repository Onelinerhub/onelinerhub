# How do I join two arrays using Python and NumPy?
// plain

Joining two arrays using Python and NumPy is a simple task. NumPy provides the `concatenate()` function which can be used to join two arrays. The syntax for `concatenate()` is as follows:

```
numpy.concatenate((array1, array2), axis)
```

where `array1` and `array2` are the two arrays that are to be joined, and `axis` is an optional argument which specifies the axis along which the two arrays are to be joined. If `axis` is not specified, the arrays are flattened before being joined.

For example, let's say we have two arrays `a` and `b`:

```
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
```

We can join them along the row axis (axis=0) using `concatenate()` as follows:

```
np.concatenate((a, b), axis=0)
```

The output of this code will be:

```
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4],
       [5, 6],
       [7, 8]])
```

## Code explanation

1. `numpy.concatenate((array1, array2), axis)`: The syntax for `concatenate()` which is used to join two arrays.
2. `array1` and `array2`: The two arrays which are to be joined.
3. `axis`: An optional argument which specifies the axis along which the two arrays are to be joined.
