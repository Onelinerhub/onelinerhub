# How do I update Python SciPy?
// plain

1. To update Python SciPy, you should first check the version of SciPy you have installed. This can be done by running the following code block in your terminal:

```
import scipy
scipy.__version__
```

## Output example
 `1.4.1`

2. If you have an older version of SciPy installed, you can update it by using the pip package manager. For example, to update SciPy to the latest version, run the following code block:

```
pip install --upgrade scipy
```

3. You can also use the Anaconda package manager to update SciPy. To do this, open the Anaconda Prompt and type in the following code:

```
conda update scipy
```

4. If you are using a Linux system, you can also use the apt package manager to update SciPy. To do this, run the following code block in the terminal:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
```

5. Once the update is complete, you can check the version of SciPy you have installed by running the same code as in step 1.

6. It is important to note that updating SciPy may require you to update other packages that depend on SciPy.

7. For more information on updating SciPy, see the [official documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/install.html).
