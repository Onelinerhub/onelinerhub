# How can I use Python Numpy to select elements from an array based on multiple conditions?
// plain

To select elements from an array based on multiple conditions using Python Numpy, we can use the `np.where()` function. This function takes a condition as an argument, and returns the indices of the elements in the array that satisfy the condition.

For example:
```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

indices = np.where((arr > 2) & (arr < 8))

print(indices)
```
This will output `(array([0, 1, 1, 2], dtype=int64), array([1, 0, 1, 2], dtype=int64))`

The `np.where()` function can take multiple conditions, which are evaluated using the bitwise operators `&` (and) and `|` (or).

The parts of the code are:
- `np.where()`: function used to select elements from an array based on multiple conditions
- `arr > 2`: condition to select elements greater than 2
- `arr < 8`: condition to select elements less than 8
- `&`: bitwise operator to combine the two conditions
