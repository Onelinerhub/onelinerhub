// plain

Upgrading the Python Scipy package can be done in a few different ways.

1. Using `pip`:
```
pip install --upgrade scipy
```
The `--upgrade` flag tells `pip` to upgrade any already installed packages to their latest version.

2. Using `conda`:
```
conda update scipy
```
This will update the Scipy package to the latest version.

3. Downloading source code and installing manually:
You can download the source code for the latest version of Scipy from [here](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html). Then install it manually by running the following command:
```
python setup.py install
```

These are the three main ways to upgrade the Python Scipy package.
