# How can I solve a differential equation using Python and SciPy?
// plain

To solve a differential equation using Python and SciPy, you can use the `odeint` function from `scipy.integrate`. This function takes a function of the form `dy/dx = f(x, y)` and an initial value, and returns the array of values for the solution at each point in the interval.

For example, to solve the differential equation `dy/dx = x + y` with initial value `y(0) = 0`, you could use the following code:

```python
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import numpy as np

def f(y, x):
    return x + y

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = odeint(f, 0, x)

print(y)
```

## Output example

```
[[ 0.        ]
 [ 0.2040404 ]
 [ 0.40808081]
 ...
 [10.91919192]
 [11.12323232]
 [11.32727273]]
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `from scipy.integrate import odeint`: imports the `odeint` function from `scipy.integrate`
2. `import numpy as np`: imports the `numpy` library as `np`
3. `def f(y, x):`: defines the function `f(x, y)` for the differential equation
4. `x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)`: creates an array of 100 equally spaced values between 0 and 10
5. `y = odeint(f, 0, x)`: solves the differential equation using `odeint`
6. `print(y)`: prints the array of values for the solution
