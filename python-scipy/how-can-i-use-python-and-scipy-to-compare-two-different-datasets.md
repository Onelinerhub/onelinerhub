Using Python and SciPy to compare two different datasets can be done in several ways.

1. **Calculating the Correlation Coefficient**: The correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two datasets. To calculate the correlation coefficient, we can use the `pearsonr()` function from SciPy's `stats` module.

```
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

# Calculate the correlation coefficient
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8]
corr, _ = pearsonr(x, y)

# Output
print('Pearsons correlation: %.3f' % corr)

# Output
Pearsons correlation: 1.000
```

2. **Calculating the Mean Squared Error**: The mean squared error (MSE) measures the average of the squares of the errors between the predicted values and the observed values. To calculate the MSE, we can use the `mean_squared_error()` function from SciPy's `metrics` module.

```
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Calculate the MSE
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8]
mse = mean_squared_error(x, y)

# Output
print('Mean Squared Error: %.3f' % mse)

# Output
Mean Squared Error: 0.000
```

3. **Calculating the Mutual Information**: Mutual information (MI) measures the amount of information shared between two datasets. To calculate the MI, we can use the `mutual_info_score()` function from SciPy's `metrics` module.

```
from sklearn.metrics import mutual_info_score

# Calculate the MI
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8]
mi = mutual_info_score(x, y)

# Output
print('Mutual Information: %.3f' % mi)

# Output
Mutual Information: 1.000
```
