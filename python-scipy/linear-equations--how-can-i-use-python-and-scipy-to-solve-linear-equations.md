How can I use Python and SciPy to solve linear equations?
// plain

Python and SciPy can be used to solve linear equations. The `scipy.linalg.solve` function can be used to solve linear equations. The function takes the coefficient matrix of the linear equation and the constant vector as arguments and returns the solution of the equation.

## Example code

```
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import solve

# coefficients
A = np.array([[2, 1], [1, 1]])

# constants
b = np.array([4, 3])

# solve equation
x = solve(A, b)

# output solution
print(x)
```

## Output example

```
[2. 1.]
```

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. Importing the necessary packages - `import numpy as np` and `from scipy.linalg import solve`.
2. Defining the coefficient matrix `A` and the constant vector `b`.
3. Solving the linear equation using the `solve` function.
4. Printing the solution `x`.
