# How do I integrate Scipy with Python?
// plain

Scipy is a collection of open source scientific and numerical computing tools for Python. It provides a wide range of functions for numerical integration, optimization, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing, and more. To integrate Scipy with Python, you need to first install the Scipy library. This can be done using the command `pip install scipy` on the command line.

Once Scipy is installed, you can import the library into your Python code using the following code block:

```
import scipy
```

You can then access the various functions and modules of the library by calling them from the `scipy` namespace. For example, to use the numerical integration module, you can use the following code:

```
import scipy.integrate

result = scipy.integrate.quad(lambda x: x**2, 0, 3)
print(result)
```

This will output the following result:

```
(9.0, 1.1102230246251565e-14)
```

The first value in the tuple is the result of the integration, and the second value is the estimated error.

To learn more about how to use Scipy with Python, you can refer to the [official Scipy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html).
