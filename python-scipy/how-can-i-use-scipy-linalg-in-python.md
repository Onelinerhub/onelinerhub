# How can I use scipy linalg in Python?
// plain

Scipy linalg is a Python library that provides a collection of linear algebra routines. It is part of the SciPy library and can be used to solve linear equations, compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and perform matrix factorization.

## Example code

```
import scipy.linalg as linalg

A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
b = np.array([1,2])

x = linalg.solve(A, b)
```

## Output example

```
array([-2.,  1.])
```

The code above uses scipy.linalg to solve a system of linear equations. First, we import the linalg module from scipy. Then, we define the matrix A and the vector b. Finally, we use the solve method to solve the system of equations and return the solution vector x.

The list of functions available in scipy.linalg includes:
* solve - solve a system of linear equations
* eig - compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* lu - compute the LU decomposition of a matrix
* cholesky - compute the Cholesky decomposition of a matrix
* qr - compute the QR decomposition of a matrix
* svd - compute the singular value decomposition of a matrix
