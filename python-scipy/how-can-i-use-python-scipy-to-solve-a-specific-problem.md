# How can I use Python Scipy to solve a specific problem?
// plain

Python Scipy is a library of scientific computing tools that can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, you can use Scipy to solve a system of linear equations.

```
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import solve

A = np.array([[3,1], [1,2]])
b = np.array([9,8])

x = solve(A, b)

print(x)
```

## Output example

```
[2. 3.]
```

The code above solves the system of linear equations A * x = b, where A is a 2x2 matrix, b is a 2x1 vector, and x is a 2x1 vector of unknowns.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Import the numpy and scipy libraries: `import numpy as np` and `from scipy.linalg import solve`
2. Define the matrix A and the vector b: `A = np.array([[3,1], [1,2]])` and `b = np.array([9,8])`
3. Solve the system of linear equations: `x = solve(A, b)`
4. Print the solution: `print(x)`
