# How do I integrate scipy with Python?
// plain

Scipy is a library of scientific computing tools for Python, and it can be integrated with Python in several ways.

The most direct way is to import the library directly into a Python script. This can be done with the following code:
```
import scipy
```

Another way is to use a package manager such as pip. This can be done with the following code:
```
pip install scipy
```

In addition, you can use the Anaconda distribution, which includes scipy as part of its core packages. This can be done with the following code:
```
conda install scipy
```

Once scipy is installed, you can use it in your Python code. For example, you can use the scipy.stats module to calculate statistics such as the mean, median, and variance of a dataset:
```
import scipy.stats

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = scipy.stats.mean(data)
print(mean)

# Output: 3.0
```

## Code explanation

- `import scipy`: imports the scipy library into your Python script
- `pip install scipy`: uses pip to install scipy
- `conda install scipy`: uses Anaconda to install scipy
- `import scipy.stats`: imports the scipy.stats module
- `scipy.stats.mean(data)`: uses the scipy.stats module to calculate the mean of a dataset
