# How do I calculate the variance with Python and NumPy?
// plain

To calculate the variance with Python and NumPy, you can use the `var()` method. This method takes in an array of values and returns the variance of the values.

```
import numpy as np

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

variance = np.var(data)

print(variance)
```

## Output example

```
2.5
```

The code above consists of four parts:
1. `import numpy as np`: This imports the NumPy library which provides the `var()` method.
2. `data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`: This creates an array of values.
3. `variance = np.var(data)`: This calculates the variance of the values in the array.
4. `print(variance)`: This prints the variance to the console.

For more information, see the [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.var.html).
