# How can I use Python SciPy to calculate the Hilbert transform?
// plain

The SciPy library provides a number of functions for performing the Hilbert transform. The most basic of these is `scipy.signal.hilbert()`, which takes a signal `x` as an argument and returns the analytical signal, `y`, which is the result of the Hilbert transform.

For example:

```
import scipy.signal as sig
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 0.1)
y = np.sin(x)

y_hilbert = sig.hilbert(y)
```

The output of this code is an array of complex numbers, `y_hilbert`, which is the result of the Hilbert transform.

The following list describes the parts of the code in more detail:

1. `import scipy.signal as sig`: imports the SciPy signal module, which contains the `hilbert()` function.
2. `import numpy as np`: imports the NumPy library, which is used to generate the signal `x`.
3. `x = np.arange(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 0.1)`: creates an array of values from -2π to 2π in increments of 0.1.
4. `y = np.sin(x)`: creates an array of values which are the sine of the values in `x`.
5. `y_hilbert = sig.hilbert(y)`: performs the Hilbert transform on the signal `y`.

More information about the SciPy Hilbert transform functions can be found in the [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html#hilbert-transform).
