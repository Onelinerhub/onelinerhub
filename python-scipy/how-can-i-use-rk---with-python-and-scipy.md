# How can I use RK45 with Python and SciPy?
// plain

RK45 is an implementation of the Runge-Kutta 4th/5th order numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It can be used with Python and SciPy to solve ODEs.

To use RK45 with Python and SciPy, the following code can be used:

```
from scipy.integrate import RK45
def f(t, y):
    return y

solver = RK45(f, 0, [1], 1)
solver.step()
print(solver.t, solver.y)
```

This code will output `1 [1.0]`, indicating that the solution of the ODE at time `t=1` is `y=1.0`.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Importing the `RK45` class from the `scipy.integrate` module: `from scipy.integrate import RK45`
2. Defining the ODE to be solved: `def f(t, y): return y`
3. Creating an instance of the `RK45` class: `solver = RK45(f, 0, [1], 1)`
4. Advancing the solution one step: `solver.step()`
5. Printing the solution: `print(solver.t, solver.y)`
