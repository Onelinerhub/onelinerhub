# How can I use Python and NumPy to answer specific questions?
// plain

Python and NumPy can be used to answer specific questions by performing calculations on data. For example, a NumPy array can be used to store data and then calculations can be performed on the data to answer the question.

```
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array of numbers
data = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])

# Calculate the sum of the array
sum = np.sum(data)

# Print the sum
print(sum)

# Output
15
```

The code above creates a NumPy array of numbers and then calculates the sum of the array using the NumPy function `np.sum()`. The output of the code is `15`.

The parts of the code are:
- `import numpy as np`: imports the NumPy library
- `data = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])`: creates a NumPy array of numbers
- `sum = np.sum(data)`: calculates the sum of the array
- `print(sum)`: prints the sum
