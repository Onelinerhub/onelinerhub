# How can I use Python and SciPy to calculate correlation coefficients?
// plain

Using Python and SciPy, you can calculate correlation coefficients with the `scipy.stats.pearsonr` function. This function takes two arrays of the same size as arguments and returns a tuple of the Pearson correlation coefficient and the p-value for the correlation.

For example, to calculate the correlation coefficient between two arrays `x` and `y`, you would use the following code:
```
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

coeff, p_value = pearsonr(x, y)
```
The output of this code would be a tuple with the correlation coefficient and the p-value.

## Code explanation


1. `from scipy.stats import pearsonr`: This imports the pearsonr function from the scipy.stats module.
2. `coeff, p_value = pearsonr(x, y)`: This calls the pearsonr function and assigns the returned tuple of correlation coefficient and p-value to the variables `coeff` and `p_value`.
