# How can I use Python, NumPy, and Jupyter Notebook to develop software?
// plain

Python, NumPy, and Jupyter Notebook are powerful tools for developing software. Here is an example of how to use them together:

```
import numpy as np

# Create an array of numbers
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Calculate the mean
mean = np.mean(data)

# Print the result
print(mean)
```

The output of this code is `3.0`.

Using these tools, you can:

1. Write code in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Import and use the NumPy library to perform calculations on data.
3. Use the Python language to create functions and classes.
