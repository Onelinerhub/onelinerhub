# How can I use Scipy with Python?
// plain

Scipy is a Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. It provides a wide range of numerical algorithms and high-level commands for manipulating and visualizing data. It is built on top of NumPy, and extends its capabilities with a large collection of high-level scientific computing functions.

To use Scipy with Python, you first need to install the library. This can be done using pip or conda:

```
pip install scipy
conda install scipy
```

Once installed, you can import the library into your Python script and begin using its functions. For example, the following code imports the library and calculates a numerical integration:

```
import scipy.integrate

def f(x):
    return x**2

answer, err = scipy.integrate.quad(f, 0, 1)
print(answer)
```

## Output example

```
0.33333333333333337
```

The code above imports the `scipy.integrate` module, defines a function `f(x)`, and then uses the `quad` function to calculate the numerical integration of `f(x)` from 0 to 1. The result is returned as a tuple, containing the answer and the error.

The Scipy library provides a wide range of functions for scientific computing and technical computing. Some of the most commonly used functions include:

- Optimization algorithms
- Numerical integration
- Interpolation
- Signal processing
- Image processing
- Linear algebra
