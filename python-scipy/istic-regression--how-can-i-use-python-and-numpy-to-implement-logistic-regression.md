Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It can be implemented in Python using NumPy. In order to use logistic regression, the data must be split into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to fit the logistic regression model.

## Example code

```
import numpy as np

# Create training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Fit the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

The code above imports NumPy and splits the data into training and test sets. It then fits the logistic regression model to the training set and makes predictions on the test set.

The parts of the code are:

* `import numpy as np` - imports the NumPy library
* `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)` - splits the data into training and test sets
* `model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs')` - creates the logistic regression model
* `model.fit(X_train, y_train)` - fits the model to the training set
* `y_pred = model.predict(X_test)` - makes predictions on the test set
