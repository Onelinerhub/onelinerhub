# How do I calculate the derivative of a function using Python and SciPy?
// plain

In order to calculate the derivative of a function using Python and SciPy, one can use the `scipy.misc.derivative` function. This function takes three arguments: a function, a point, and a delta. The function argument is the function for which the derivative is to be calculated, the point is the point at which the derivative is to be calculated, and the delta is the step size used in the numerical approximation.

For example, to calculate the derivative of the function `f(x) = x^2` at the point `x=3`, one can use the following code:
```
from scipy.misc import derivative

def f(x):
    return x**2

derivative(f, 3, dx=1e-6)
```
The output of this code is `6.000000000012662`.

The code can be broken down as follows:
1. The `from scipy.misc import derivative` line imports the `derivative` function from the `scipy.misc` module.
2. The `def f(x):` line defines the function `f` for which the derivative is to be calculated.
3. The `derivative(f, 3, dx=1e-6)` line calls the `derivative` function, passing in the function `f`, the point `3`, and the step size `1e-6`.
