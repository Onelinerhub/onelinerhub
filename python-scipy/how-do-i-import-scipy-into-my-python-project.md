// plain

To import scipy into your Python project, you can use the following code:
```
import scipy
```
This will import the scipy library into your project, allowing you to use its functions.

## Code explanation

- `import`: This is a keyword in Python that allows you to import modules from other libraries.
- `scipy`: This is the name of the library you are importing.

If you want to use specific functions from the scipy library, you can use the following code:
```
from scipy.special import expit
```
This will import the `expit` function from the `scipy.special` module.

## Code explanation

- `from`: This is a keyword in Python that allows you to import specific functions from other libraries.
- `scipy.special`: This is the name of the module you are importing from.
- `expit`: This is the name of the function you are importing.

For more information on importing modules and functions from other libraries, please refer to the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html).
