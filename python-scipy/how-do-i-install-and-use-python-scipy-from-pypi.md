# How do I install and use Python Scipy from PyPI?
// plain

1. First, you need to install Python. You can do this by downloading the latest version from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Once you have Python installed, you need to install the `pip` package manager. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

3. Now you can use `pip` to install Scipy from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

```
pip install scipy
```

4. Once the installation is complete, you can import Scipy into your Python code and start using it. For example:

```python
import scipy

# Compute the sine of x
x = 0.5
y = scipy.sin(x)

print(y)
```

## Output example


```
0.479425538604203
```

5. You can also access the Scipy documentation to learn more about its features and functions [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/).

6. If you need help with installing or using Scipy, you can ask questions in the official [Scipy StackOverflow tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scipy).

7. Finally, you can find more information about Scipy on the official [Scipy website](https://www.scipy.org/).
