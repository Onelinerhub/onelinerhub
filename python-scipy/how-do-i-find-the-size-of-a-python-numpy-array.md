# How do I find the size of a Python numpy array?
// plain

To find the size of a Python numpy array, you can use the `numpy.size()` function. This function will return the total number of elements in the array.

For example, if you have an array `a` declared as follows:

```
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
```

Then you can use the `numpy.size()` function to find the size of the array `a` as follows:

```
size_a = np.size(a)
print(size_a)
```

The output of this code will be:

```
6
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import numpy as np`: This imports the `numpy` library as `np` so that it can be used in the code.
2. `a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])`: This creates a 2D array with the given elements.
3. `size_a = np.size(a)`: This calls the `numpy.size()` function to find the size of the array `a`.
4. `print(size_a)`: This prints the size of the array `a`.
