# How do I use the Python Numpy Arange function?
// plain

The `numpy.arange` function is a powerful tool for generating sequences of numbers in Python. It takes three arguments: start, stop, and step size. The start argument is the first number in the sequence, the stop argument is the last number in the sequence, and the step size argument is the size of the step between each number in the sequence.

For example, the following code will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10, with a step size of 2:

```
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(0, 10, 2)
print(x)
```

## Output example

```
[0 2 4 6 8]
```

The code consists of three parts:
* `import numpy as np` - This imports the Numpy library, and assigns it to the variable `np`.
* `x = np.arange(0, 10, 2)` - This creates an array of numbers from 0 to 10, with a step size of 2.
* `print(x)` - This prints out the array of numbers.
