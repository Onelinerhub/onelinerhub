# How can I use Python and Numpy to zip files?
// plain

Python and Numpy can be used to zip files in a few different ways.

One way is to use the shutil library to compress a file into a zip archive. This library provides a function called `make_archive` which can be used to create a zip archive.

## Example code

```
import shutil

shutil.make_archive('my_zip_file', 'zip', 'C:\\path\\to\\folder')
```

This code will create a zip archive named `my_zip_file.zip` in the current working directory, containing the contents of the folder located at `C:\\path\\to\\folder`.

Another way to create a zip archive is to use the zipfile library. This library provides a function called `ZipFile` which can be used to create a zip archive.

## Example code

```
import zipfile

zf = zipfile.ZipFile('my_zip_file.zip', 'w')
zf.write('C:\\path\\to\\file.txt')
zf.close()
```

This code will create a zip archive named `my_zip_file.zip` in the current working directory, containing the file located at `C:\\path\\to\\file.txt`.

Finally, Numpy can be used to zip files by using the `savez` function. This function can be used to save multiple arrays into a single zip archive.

## Example code

```
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1,2,3])
b = np.array([4,5,6])

np.savez('my_zip_file.npz', a=a, b=b)
```

This code will create a zip archive named `my_zip_file.npz` in the current working directory, containing the two arrays `a` and `b`.

In summary, Python and Numpy can be used to zip files by using the `shutil.make_archive` function, the `zipfile.ZipFile` function, or the `np.savez` function.
