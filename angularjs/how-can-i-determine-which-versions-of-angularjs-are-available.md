# How can I determine which versions of AngularJS are available?
// plain

To determine which versions of AngularJS are available, you can use the `npm view` command. This command will list the available versions of the package. For example, to check the available versions of AngularJS, run the following command:

```
npm view angular
```

This will output a list of available versions of AngularJS, such as:

```
angular@1.7.8
angular@1.7.7
angular@1.7.6
angular@1.7.5
angular@1.7.4
angular@1.7.3
angular@1.7.2
angular@1.7.1
angular@1.7.0
...
```

The `npm view` command can also be used to check the available versions of any other package.
