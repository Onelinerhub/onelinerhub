# How can I find the latest version of AngularJS?
// plain

The latest version of AngularJS can be found on the official website.

To install the latest version, you can use the following command:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
This will install the Angular CLI, which is the command line interface for Angular.

The version of AngularJS that is installed can be checked by running the following command:
```
ng --version
```
This will output the version of AngularJS that is currently installed.

The following list outlines the parts of the command:
- `npm install`: This is the command to install a package.
- `-g`: This flag tells npm to install the package globally, which means it will be available system-wide.
- `@angular/cli`: This is the name of the package that will be installed.
- `ng`: This is the command to run the Angular CLI.
- `--version`: This flag tells the CLI to output the version of AngularJS that is currently installed.
