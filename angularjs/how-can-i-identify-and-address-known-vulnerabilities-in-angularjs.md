# How can I identify and address known vulnerabilities in AngularJS?
// plain

To identify and address known vulnerabilities in AngularJS, you can use a static code analysis tool such as [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/). It can detect and report security issues in your application code and provide guidance on how to fix them.

You can also use the [AngularJS security audit tool](https://github.com/mgechev/angularjs-security-audit) to detect and address known AngularJS vulnerabilities. This tool will scan your codebase and report any potential issues.

You can also use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in your AngularJS code. ESLint is a linting tool that can detect potential issues such as insecure coding practices and insecure libraries.

For example, the following code snippet will produce a warning from ESLint about the use of an insecure library:

```javascript
var myLib = require('insecure-library');
```

**Output:**

`warning  Unexpected 'insecure-library'  no-restricted-modules`

The warning indicates that the `insecure-library` library should not be used.

You can also review the [AngularJS Security Checklist](https://github.com/mgechev/angularjs-security-checklist) for a comprehensive list of security best practices when developing with AngularJS.

Finally, you should always keep your AngularJS application up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
