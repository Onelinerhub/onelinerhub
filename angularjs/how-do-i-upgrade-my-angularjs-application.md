// plain

Upgrading an AngularJS application can be done in a few steps.

1. First, you need to install the latest version of AngularJS. This can be done with the following command:
```
npm install angular@latest
```
2. Once the installation is complete, you need to update all the dependencies in your application. This can be done using the following command:
```
npm install
```
3. The next step is to update the code in your application to the latest version of AngularJS. This includes updating the controllers, directives, services, etc. to use the new APIs and features.

4. Once all the code has been updated, you need to run the application to make sure everything works as expected. This can be done with the following command:
```
ng serve
```
5. If everything works as expected, you can deploy the application to the production environment.

6. Finally, you need to make sure that all the third-party libraries and plugins used in your application are compatible with the latest version of AngularJS.

7. You can refer to the [AngularJS Upgrade Guide](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade) for more information on how to upgrade your application.

**Note:** Make sure to always test your application thoroughly before deploying it to production.
