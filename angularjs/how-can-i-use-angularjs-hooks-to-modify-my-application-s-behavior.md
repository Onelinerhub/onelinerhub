# How can I use AngularJS hooks to modify my application's behavior?
// plain

AngularJS hooks are functions that can be used to modify the behavior of an AngularJS application. For example, the `$routeChangeStart` hook can be used to check the user's authentication status before allowing them to access a certain route.

```
$rootScope.$on('$routeChangeStart', function (event, next) {
  if (!AuthService.isAuthenticated()) {
    event.preventDefault();
    $state.go('login');
  }
});
```

This code will check if the user is authenticated before allowing them to access the route. If they are not, they will be redirected to the login page.

The following are some other hooks that can be used to modify the behavior of an AngularJS application:

* `$routeChangeSuccess` - Triggered after a route change has successfully been completed.
* `$routeChangeError` - Triggered when an error occurs during a route change.
* `$stateChangeStart` - Triggered before a state change starts.
* `$stateChangeSuccess` - Triggered after a state change has successfully been completed.
* `$stateChangeError` - Triggered when an error occurs during a state change.
* `$viewContentLoaded` - Triggered after the view has been loaded.
