# How can I set up routes in AngularJS?
// plain

To set up routes in AngularJS, you need to use the `$routeProvider` service. This service allows you to define the routes for your application, and map them to controllers and views.

Here is an example of how to set up routes:

```
angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute'])
  .config(function ($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider
      .when('/', {
        templateUrl: 'views/main.html',
        controller: 'MainCtrl'
      })
      .when('/about', {
        templateUrl: 'views/about.html',
        controller: 'AboutCtrl'
      })
      .otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/'
      });
  });
```

In this example, we have defined two routes: `/`, which is the main page of the application, and `/about`, which is an about page. For each route, we have specified a `templateUrl` which is the path to the HTML template for that page, and a `controller` which is the controller associated with that page. Finally, we have specified an `otherwise` route which will redirect to the main page if a route is not found.

## Code explanation


1. `angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute'])`: This creates an AngularJS module named `myApp`, and includes the `ngRoute` module, which provides the `$routeProvider` service.

2. `.config(function ($routeProvider)`: This defines the configuration function for the module, and provides the `$routeProvider` service.

3. `.when('/', { ... })`: This defines a route for the `/` path, and specifies the `templateUrl` and `controller` for that route.

4. `.when('/about', { ... })`: This defines a route for the `/about` path, and specifies the `templateUrl` and `controller` for that route.

5. `.otherwise({ ... })`: This defines a route which will be used if none of the other routes match. In this case, it will redirect to the `/` path.
