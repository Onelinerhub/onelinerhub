# How do I use routing in AngularJS?
// plain

Routing in AngularJS is the process of switching views in an application based on certain conditions. It allows us to create single page applications (SPAs) with multiple views.

To use routing in AngularJS, we need to include the `ngRoute` module as a dependency in our application.

```
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute']);
```

Then, we need to configure our routes by using the `$routeProvider` service.

```
app.config(function($routeProvider) {
  $routeProvider
  .when('/', {
    templateUrl: 'home.html',
    controller: 'HomeController'
  })
  .when('/about', {
    templateUrl: 'about.html',
    controller: 'AboutController'
  })
  .otherwise({
    redirectTo: '/'
  });
});
```

We can also use the `$routeParams` service to get the parameters from the current URL.

```
app.controller('ProductController', function($scope, $routeParams) {
  $scope.productId = $routeParams.productId;
});
```

Finally, we need to add the `<ng-view>` directive to our HTML page, so that the views can be loaded into the page.

For more information, see the [AngularJS docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute).
