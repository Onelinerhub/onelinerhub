# How do I use AngularJS to develop applications with MetaNIT?
// plain

AngularJS is a popular JavaScript framework used for building web applications and can be used in combination with MetaNIT for developing applications.

To use AngularJS with MetaNIT, you will need to include the AngularJS library in your HTML page. This can be done by adding the following code to the head of your HTML page:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
```

Once the AngularJS library is included, you can use the MetaNIT JavaScript API to interact with MetaNIT. The MetaNIT JavaScript API provides methods to query, create, update, and delete data.

For example, the following code will query the MetaNIT data and display the results in an HTML table:

```
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
    <table>
        <tr ng-repeat="x in myData">
            <td>{{ x.name }}</td>
            <td>{{ x.age }}</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $http) {
    $http.get("data.php")
    .then(function (response) {
        $scope.myData = response.data.records;
    });
});
</script>
```

The code above will query the MetaNIT data and display the results in an HTML table. The code can be broken down into the following parts:

1. The HTML div element with the ng-app and ng-controller attributes. These attributes tell AngularJS to use the myApp module and the myCtrl controller.
2. The HTML table element with the ng-repeat attribute. This attribute tells AngularJS to loop through the myData array and display each item in the table.
3. The JavaScript code that uses the $http service to query the MetaNIT data.
