// plain

Using an AngularJS XSS cheat sheet to protect your website from malicious attacks is a great way to ensure that your website is secure. The cheat sheet provides a list of code snippets that you can use to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

For example, you can use the `ng-bind-html` directive to prevent malicious code from executing. This directive will prevent any HTML from executing in the browser, and instead display it as plain text.

```
<div ng-bind-html="expression"></div>
```

The code above will prevent any malicious code from executing in the browser.

Additionally, you can use the `$sanitize` service to prevent malicious code from executing. This service will remove any HTML tags that are present in the code, thus preventing any malicious code from executing.

```
var sanitizedHtml = $sanitize(htmlString);
```

The code above will remove any HTML tags from the `htmlString` variable, thus preventing any malicious code from executing.

Finally, you can use the `$sce` service to validate URLs. This service will ensure that any URLs present in the code are valid and not malicious.

```
var trustedUrl = $sce.trustAsResourceUrl(urlString);
```

The code above will validate the `urlString` variable and ensure that it is not malicious.

Using the code snippets provided by the AngularJS XSS cheat sheet, you can protect your website from malicious attacks.
