# How can I use AngularJS to construct an XSS payload?
// plain

AngularJS is a powerful client-side scripting framework that can be used to construct an XSS payload. It can be used to create malicious JavaScript code that can be injected into a vulnerable web application.

The following example code demonstrates how to construct an XSS payload using AngularJS:

```javascript
<script>
  angular.module('xss', [])
  .controller('payload', function($scope) {
    $scope.payload = '<script>alert("XSS")</script>';
  });
</script>
```

The code above will create a controller called `payload` that contains a variable called `payload` which contains a malicious JavaScript code that will execute an alert box with the text "XSS" when injected into a vulnerable web application.

To use the payload, the malicious code must be injected into the application. This can be done by exploiting a vulnerable input field, such as an unprotected URL parameter or form field. When the application renders the malicious code, it will be executed and the alert box will be displayed.

The following list contains parts of the code and their explanation:

1. `angular.module('xss', [])` - This creates an AngularJS module called `xss`.
2. `.controller('payload', function($scope) {})` - This creates a controller called `payload` which contains a function that takes a `$scope` parameter.
3. `$scope.payload = '<script>alert("XSS")</script>';` - This creates a variable called `payload` that contains a malicious JavaScript code.
