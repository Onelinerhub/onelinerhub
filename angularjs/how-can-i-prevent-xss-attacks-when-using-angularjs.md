# How can I prevent XSS attacks when using AngularJS?
// plain

To prevent XSS attacks when using AngularJS, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Sanitize input**: AngularJS provides the `ngSanitize` module, which can be used to sanitize HTML input. For example, the following code will sanitize a string containing HTML tags:

```javascript
var htmlString = '<h1>Hello World!</h1>';
var sanitizedHtmlString = $sanitize(htmlString);

console.log(sanitizedHtmlString); // 'Hello World!'
```

2. **Use built-in directives**: AngularJS provides built-in directives such as `ng-bind-html` and `ng-bind-template` to bind HTML content to the DOM. These directives sanitize the HTML content before binding it to the DOM, which helps prevent XSS attacks. For example, the following code will bind a string containing HTML tags to the DOM:

```html
<div ng-bind-html="htmlString"></div>
```

3. **Disable unsafe JavaScript**: AngularJS provides the `$sce` service, which can be used to disable unsafe JavaScript. This will prevent malicious JavaScript code from being executed in the browser. For example, the following code will disable unsafe JavaScript:

```javascript
$sce.getTrusted($sce.JS, 'unsafeJavaScriptCode');
```

4. **Validate user input**: It is important to validate user input to ensure that it is safe. This can be done by using regular expressions to check for malicious characters.

5. **Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Content Security Policy is a security mechanism that can be used to restrict the execution of malicious JavaScript code.

6. **Use a secure server**: It is important to use a secure server to protect against XSS attacks. The server should be configured to prevent malicious requests from being executed.

7. **Keep AngularJS up to date**: It is important to keep AngularJS up to date to ensure that the latest security patches are applied.
