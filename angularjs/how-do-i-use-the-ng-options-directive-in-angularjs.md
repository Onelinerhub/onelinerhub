# How do I use the ng-options directive in AngularJS?
// plain

The `ng-options` directive in AngularJS is used to dynamically generate a list of `<option>` elements for the `<select>` element. It provides data-binding, which means that the list of options is generated from a JavaScript array and can be changed at runtime.

## Example code

```
<select ng-model="selectedName" ng-options="x for x in names">
  <option value="">-- Select a name --</option>
</select>
```

In the example above, the `ng-model` directive sets the `selectedName` variable to the selected option from the list. The `ng-options` directive is used to generate the list of options from the `names` array. The `x for x in names` expression is used to iterate through the `names` array and generate the list of options.

## Code explanation


1. `<select>` element: This is the HTML element used to display the list of options.
2. `ng-model` directive: This directive is used to bind the selected option to the `selectedName` variable.
3. `ng-options` directive: This directive is used to generate the list of options from the `names` array.
