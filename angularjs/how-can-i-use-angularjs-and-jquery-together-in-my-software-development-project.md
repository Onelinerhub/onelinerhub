// plain

You can use AngularJS and jQuery together in your software development project by integrating jQuery into your AngularJS application. To do this, you need to include jQuery in your application's index.html file, like this:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

Then you can use jQuery in your AngularJS application by calling the jQuery function. For example, you can use jQuery to select an element in the DOM and then bind a click event to it:

```
$('#elementId').click(function() {
  // Do something when the element is clicked
});
```

You can also use jQuery to manipulate the DOM within the AngularJS application. For example, you can use jQuery to add or remove classes from an element:

```
$('#elementId').addClass('someClass');
$('#elementId').removeClass('someClass');
```

You can also use jQuery to make AJAX requests within your AngularJS application. For example:

```
$.ajax({
  url: 'https://example.com/api/data',
  type: 'GET',
  success: function(data) {
    // Do something with the returned data
  }
});
```

These are just a few examples of how you can use jQuery within your AngularJS application. For more information, see the following resources:
