# How can I use AngularJS and Jest to test my software development project?
// plain

AngularJS and Jest can be used together to test software development projects.

To do this, first set up a testing environment by creating a `package.json` file in the project directory. This file should include the Jest and AngularJS dependencies.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "angular": "^1.7.9",
    "jest": "^24.9.0"
  }
}
```

Then, create a `jest.config.js` file in the project directory, which should contain the configuration for the Jest testing environment. This should include the test environment, which should be set to `"jsdom"`, and the testRegex, which should be set to `".spec.js$"` to ensure that only test files are run.

```js
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: "jsdom",
  testRegex: ".spec.js$"
};
```

Finally, create test files for each component of the project. These files should include the necessary imports, such as AngularJS and the component to be tested, and should contain the test cases for each component.

```js
import { MyComponent } from './my-component';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should do something', () => {
    // test code here
  });
});
```

Once all the necessary files are in place, the tests can be run using the `jest` command.
