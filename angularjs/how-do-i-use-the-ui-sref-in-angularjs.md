# How do I use the ui-sref in AngularJS?
// plain

The ui-sref directive in AngularJS is used to create a link to a state in the application's UI-Router. It is an alternative to using the `<a href>` HTML element.

Here is an example of using `ui-sref`:

```html
<a ui-sref="stateName">Link Text</a>
```

This will create a link to the state named `stateName` with link text of `Link Text`.

The parts of the `ui-sref` directive are as follows:

1. `ui-sref`: This is the directive name.
2. `stateName`: This is the name of the state that the link will point to.
3. `Link Text`: This is the text that will be displayed in the link.
