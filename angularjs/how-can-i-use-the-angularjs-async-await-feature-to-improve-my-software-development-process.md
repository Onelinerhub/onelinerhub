# How can I use the AngularJS async await feature to improve my software development process?
// plain

The async/await feature of AngularJS can be used to improve software development processes by making asynchronous code more readable and maintainable. Here is an example of how to use the async/await feature in an AngularJS application:

```
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://example.com/data');
    const json = await response.json();
    console.log(json);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
}
getData();
```

## Output example

```
[{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": "30"
},
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "age": "25"
}]
```

The code above uses the async/await feature to make an asynchronous call to a server and retrieve JSON data. The code is more readable and maintainable than using the traditional callback approach.

The code can be broken down into the following parts:
- `async function getData()`: This declares an asynchronous function that can be called to retrieve data from the server.
- `try {`: This is used to handle any errors that may occur when making the asynchronous call.
- `const response = await fetch('http://example.com/data');`: This makes an asynchronous call to the server to retrieve the data.
- `const json = await response.json();`: This parses the response from the server into a JSON object.
- `console.log(json);`: This prints out the data retrieved from the server.
- `} catch (e) {`: This is used to catch any errors that may occur when making the asynchronous call.
- `console.log(e);`: This prints out the error message if an error occurs.

Using the async/await feature in AngularJS can help improve software development processes by making asynchronous code more readable and maintainable.
