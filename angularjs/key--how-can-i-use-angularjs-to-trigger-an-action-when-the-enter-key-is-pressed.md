How can I use AngularJS to trigger an action when the enter key is pressed?
// plain

The AngularJS framework has a directive called `ng-keypress` which can be used to trigger an action when the enter key is pressed. The following example code shows how to use this directive to call a function called `myFunction` when the enter key is pressed:

```
<input type="text" ng-keypress="myFunction($event)">

<script>
    function myFunction($event) {
        if ($event.which === 13) {
            // Trigger the action here
        }
    }
</script>
```

When the user presses the enter key, the `myFunction` function will be called and the `$event` object will contain information about the key press. In this example, we are checking the `which` property of the `$event` object to see if it is equal to 13, which is the key code for the enter key. If it is equal to 13, we can then trigger the action that we want to take place.

## Code explanation


- `<input type="text" ng-keypress="myFunction($event)">`: This HTML element is used to create an input field in the page. The `ng-keypress` directive is used to call the `myFunction` function when the enter key is pressed.

- `function myFunction($event) {`: This is the `myFunction` function which is called when the enter key is pressed. The `$event` object is passed to the function which contains information about the key press.

- `if ($event.which === 13) {`: This line checks the `which` property of the `$event` object to see if it is equal to 13, which is the key code for the enter key.

- `// Trigger the action here`: This is where the action that needs to be triggered when the enter key is pressed should be placed.
