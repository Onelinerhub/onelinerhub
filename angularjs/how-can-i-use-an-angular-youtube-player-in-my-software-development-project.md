# How can I use an Angular YouTube Player in my software development project?
// plain

To use an Angular YouTube Player in your software development project, you will need to install the Angular YouTube Player package. The package can be installed with the following command:

```
npm install angular-youtube-player
```

Once the package is installed, you can import the YouTube Player module into your project and use it in your components. Here is an example of how to use the YouTube Player in a component:

```
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { YoutubePlayerService } from 'angular-youtube-player';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponentComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private youtubePlayerService: YoutubePlayerService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.youtubePlayerService.playerReady
      .subscribe(player => {
        player.playVideo();
      });
  }

}
```

The code above will subscribe to the playerReady event of the YouTube Player and, when the player is ready, it will play the video.

Parts of the code:

- `import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';` - imports the Component and OnInit interfaces from the `@angular/core` package.
- `import { YoutubePlayerService } from 'angular-youtube-player';` - imports the YouTube Player Service from the `angular-youtube-player` package.
- `@Component({ ... })` - decorates the component class with the Component metadata.
- `constructor(private youtubePlayerService: YoutubePlayerService) { }` - injects the YouTube Player Service into the component.
- `ngOnInit(): void { ... }` - implements the OnInit interface and subscribes to the playerReady event.
- `player.playVideo();` - calls the playVideo method of the player when it is ready.
