// plain

Using an AngularJS element in your software development project is easy.

1. First, you need to include the AngularJS library in your project. You can do this by adding the following line to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:
```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
```
2. Next, you need to create an AngularJS element. This is done by using the `ng-app` directive. For example, the following code will create an AngularJS element called `myApp`:
```html
<div ng-app="myApp">
  ...
</div>
```
3. Once you have created the element, you can add your own custom code inside the `<div>` tags. For example:
```html
<div ng-app="myApp">
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>
```
4. Finally, you need to define the `message` variable inside the `<script>` tags. This is done using the `$scope` object. For example:
```javascript
<script>
  var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
  app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.message = 'Hello World!';
  });
</script>
```

The output of the code above will be:
```
Hello World!
```
