# How do I implement one-way binding in AngularJS?
// plain

One-way binding in AngularJS is implemented through the use of the `ng-bind` directive. This directive binds the value of an expression to the HTML element it is applied to.

For example, to bind the value of a `name` variable to an HTML element, the following code can be used:

```
<div ng-bind="name"></div>
```

This will display the value of `name` in the `div` element.

## Code explanation


- `ng-bind`: The directive used to bind the value of an expression to an HTML element.
- Expression: The expression whose value is to be bound to an HTML element.
