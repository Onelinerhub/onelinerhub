# How can I migrate my existing application to AngularJS?
// plain

Migrating an existing application to AngularJS requires a few steps.

1. First, you need to include the AngularJS library in your HTML page. This can be done by adding the following code to your page:
```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
```
This will allow you to use AngularJS in your application.

2. Next, you need to define an AngularJS module. This can be done by adding the following code to your page:
```
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);
```
This will create an AngularJS module named 'myApp'.

3. After that, you need to create an AngularJS controller. This can be done by adding the following code to your page:
```
myApp.controller('MyController', function($scope) {
    // Your code here
});
```
This will create an AngularJS controller named 'MyController'.

4. Then, you need to use the AngularJS directives to bind the data from the controller to the HTML elements. This can be done by adding the following code to your page:
```
<div ng-controller="MyController">
    <p>{{message}}</p>
</div>
```
This will bind the data from the controller to the HTML element.

5. Finally, you need to add the necessary code to your controller to make the data available to the HTML elements. This can be done by adding the following code to your controller:
```
$scope.message = 'Hello World!';
```
This will make the data available to the HTML element.

By following the steps above, you can migrate your existing application to AngularJS.
