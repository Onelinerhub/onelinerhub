// plain

When deciding between AngularJS and Vue.js for a software development project, there are a few things to consider.

1. **Ease of Learning**: AngularJS is a full-featured framework that requires more time to learn and use. Vue.js is a more lightweight framework that is easier to learn and use.

2. **Performance**: AngularJS is a more powerful framework that can handle large projects, but it may be slower than Vue.js due to its complexity. Vue.js is designed for faster performance and can handle smaller projects more efficiently.

3. **Scalability**: AngularJS is a more scalable framework due to its larger feature set. Vue.js is more suited for smaller projects and may not be able to handle large projects as well.

4. **Community Support**: AngularJS has a large community of developers and resources, while Vue.js is still growing in popularity.

5. **Example Code**:

```
// AngularJS
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);

app.controller('myController', function($scope) {
  $scope.name = 'John Doe';
});

// Vue.js
var app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    name: 'John Doe'
  }
});
```

Ultimately, the decision between AngularJS and Vue.js will depend on the specific needs of the project. Weighing the pros and cons of each framework and considering the project's requirements can help you make the right decision.
