# How do I use the location service in AngularJS?
// plain

Using the Location service in AngularJS is a great way to manage the navigation of your web application. It allows you to update the URL in the browser's address bar, as well as enable the user to navigate between different states of your application. To use the Location service, you must first include the `ngRoute` module in your application's module declaration.

```javascript
var app = angular.module("myApp", ["ngRoute"]);
```

Then, you must inject the `$location` service into your controller.

```javascript
app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope, $location) {
    // code here
});
```

Once you have injected the service, you can use it to get the current URL, redirect the user to a new page, and more.

For example, to get the current URL, you can use the `$location.absUrl()` method.

```javascript
$scope.currentURL = $location.absUrl();
console.log($scope.currentURL); // Outputs the current URL
```

To redirect the user to a new page, you can use the `$location.url()` method.

```javascript
$location.url("/about"); // Redirects the user to the /about page
```

You can also use the `$location.search()` method to get the query parameters from the current URL.

```javascript
$scope.queryParams = $location.search();
console.log($scope.queryParams); // Outputs the query parameters from the current URL
```

For more information, see the [AngularJS Documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$location).
