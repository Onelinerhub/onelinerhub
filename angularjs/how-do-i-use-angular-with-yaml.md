# How do I use Angular with YAML?
// plain

Using Angular with YAML is a great way to create dynamic web applications. YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" and is a human-readable data serialization language. It is often used for configuration files, but can also be used to store data in a structured format.

To use Angular with YAML, you need to install the [`yaml-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-js) package. This package provides a parser and serializer for YAML.

Once `yaml-js` is installed, you can use it to parse YAML files and convert them into JSON objects. This can then be used in your Angular application.

For example, if you have a YAML file like this:

```
name: John
age: 30
```

You can use `yaml-js` to parse it into a JSON object like this:

```js
const yaml = require('yaml-js');

const data = yaml.load(`name: John
age: 30`);

console.log(data);
// { name: 'John', age: 30 }
```

Once you have the data in a JSON object, you can use it in your Angular application. For example, you could use it to populate a form:

```js
// Assume we have a form component like this
@Component({
  selector: 'app-form',
  template: `
    <form>
      <input type="text" name="name" [(ngModel)]="data.name" />
      <input type="number" name="age" [(ngModel)]="data.age" />
    </form>
  `
})
export class FormComponent {
  data = { name: '', age: 0 };
}

// Now we can set the data from our YAML file
const yaml = require('yaml-js');

const data = yaml.load(`name: John
age: 30`);

formComponent.data = data;
```

This is just one example of how you can use Angular with YAML. There are many more possibilities, depending on your application's needs.
