# How do I install Yarn using Angular?
// plain

Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that can be used to manage dependencies for an Angular project. It can be installed using npm, the Node Package Manager.

To install Yarn using Angular, first install the Yarn package globally using npm:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

This will install Yarn globally so that it can be used with any project.

Next, create a package.json file in the root directory of the Angular project. This file will store the project's dependencies and will be used by Yarn to install the dependencies.

Then, run the following command to install the dependencies listed in the package.json file:

```
yarn install
```

This will install all of the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Finally, run the following command to update the dependencies to their latest version:

```
yarn upgrade
```

This will update all of the dependencies to their latest version.
