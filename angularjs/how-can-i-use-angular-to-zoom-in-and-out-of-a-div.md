# How can I use Angular to zoom in and out of a div?
// plain

Zooming in and out of a div can be accomplished using Angular. In order to do so, you will need to install the [ngx-zoom-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-zoom). Once installed, you can use the zoom directive to specify the element you want to zoom in and out of.

For example, the following code block will allow you to zoom in and out of a div with id 'zoomDiv':
```
<div id="zoomDiv" zoom>
    <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

In addition, you can also specify the zoom level and the zoom step size. The zoom level is the amount of zoom applied when the zoom directive is applied and the zoom step size is the amount of zoom applied when the zoom is increased or decreased.

For example, the following code block will allow you to zoom in and out of a div with id 'zoomDiv' with a zoom level of 2 and a zoom step size of 0.5:
```
<div id="zoomDiv" zoom [zoomLevel]="2" [zoomStep]="0.5">
    <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

There are also other options available such as the ability to specify the max and min zoom level, the zoom button size, and the zoom button position. To learn more about the available options and how to use them, please refer to the [ngx-zoom-library documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-zoom).
