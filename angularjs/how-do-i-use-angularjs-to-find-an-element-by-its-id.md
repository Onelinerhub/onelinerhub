# How do I use AngularJS to find an element by its ID?
// plain

Using AngularJS to find an element by its ID is easy. All you need to do is use the `document.getElementById()` method. Here's an example:

```
// Get the element with id="demo"
var x = document.getElementById("demo");
```

The variable `x` now contains the element with the specified ID.

The parts of the code are as follows:

1. `document.getElementById()` - This is the method that is used to find an element by its ID.
2. `"demo"` - This is the ID of the element that you want to find.
3. `var x` - This is the variable that will contain the element with the specified ID.
