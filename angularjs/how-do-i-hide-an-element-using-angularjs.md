# How do I hide an element using AngularJS?
// plain

The AngularJS framework provides a directive called `ng-hide` which can be used to hide an element. Here is an example of how to use it:

```
<div ng-hide="hideElement">
  This element will be hidden if hideElement is set to true.
</div>
```

The `ng-hide` directive evaluates the expression provided to it. If the expression is true, the element will be hidden. If the expression is false, the element will be visible.

## Code explanation


1. `ng-hide` - This is the directive used to hide an element.
2. `hideElement` - This is the expression which is evaluated when the `ng-hide` directive is applied.
