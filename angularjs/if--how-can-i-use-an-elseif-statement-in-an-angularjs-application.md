How can I use an elseif statement in an AngularJS application?
// plain

An `elseif` statement is a type of control flow statement that is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met. In an AngularJS application, the `elseif` statement can be used to control the flow of the application based on certain conditions.

For example, the following code block will check if a variable `x` is equal to `5`. If it is, then it will execute the code in the `if` block. Otherwise, it will check if `x` is equal to `10`, and, if it is, it will execute the code in the `elseif` block. If neither condition is met, it will execute the code in the `else` block.

```
if (x === 5) {
    // Execute code in this block if x is equal to 5
} elseif (x === 10) {
    // Execute code in this block if x is equal to 10
} else {
    // Execute code in this block if x is not equal to 5 or 10
}
```

The parts of the code block are as follows:

* `if`: This is the keyword used to start the `if` statement.
* `(x === 5)`: This is the condition that will be evaluated.
* `{`: This is the opening curly brace that indicates the start of the code block.
* `// Execute code in this block if x is equal to 5`: This is the code that will be executed if the condition evaluates to `true`.
* `}`: This is the closing curly brace that indicates the end of the code block.
* `elseif`: This is the keyword used to start the `elseif` statement.
* `(x === 10)`: This is the condition that will be evaluated.
* `{`: This is the opening curly brace that indicates the start of the code block.
* `// Execute code in this block if x is equal to 10`: This is the code that will be executed if the condition evaluates to `true`.
* `}`: This is the closing curly brace that indicates the end of the code block.
* `else`: This is the keyword used to start the `else` statement.
* `{`: This is the opening curly brace that indicates the start of the code block.
* `// Execute code in this block if x is not equal to 5 or 10`: This is the code that will be executed if none of the conditions evaluate to `true`.
* `}`: This is the closing curly brace that indicates the end of the code block.
