# How do I use $q.all in AngularJS?
// plain

The `$q.all` method in AngularJS allows you to execute multiple promises in parallel and wait for all of them to resolve before continuing. This method takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that will be resolved when all of the input promises have been resolved.

For example, the following code uses `$q.all` to wait for two promises to be resolved before logging the result to the console:

```javascript
var promise1 = $q.resolve(1);
var promise2 = $q.resolve(2);

$q.all([promise1, promise2]).then(function(results) {
  console.log(results); // [1, 2]
});
```

The `$q.all` method can also be used to execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and wait for all of them to succeed before continuing. For example, the following code uses `$q.all` to wait for two asynchronous operations to be completed before logging the result to the console:

```javascript
function asyncOperation1() {
  return $q(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(1);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

function asyncOperation2() {
  return $q(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(2);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

$q.all([asyncOperation1(), asyncOperation2()]).then(function(results) {
  console.log(results); // [1, 2]
});
```

The `$q.all` method can be used to execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and wait for all of them to succeed before continuing. It takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that will be resolved when all of the input promises have been resolved.
