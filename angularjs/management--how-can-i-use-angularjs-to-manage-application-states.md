How can I use AngularJS to manage application states?
// plain

AngularJS is a powerful JavaScript framework that can be used to manage application states. It provides a feature called `$state` which allows developers to define different states for the application and transition between them.

For example, the following code can be used to define two states, `home` and `about`, and transition between them:

```javascript
$stateProvider
  .state('home', {
    url: '/',
    templateUrl: 'home.html',
    controller: 'HomeCtrl'
  })
  .state('about', {
    url: '/about',
    templateUrl: 'about.html',
    controller: 'AboutCtrl'
  });
```

## Code explanation

- `$stateProvider`: This is the provider used to define the different states for the application.
- `state('home', {...})`: This is used to define the `home` state, including the URL, the template URL and the controller.
- `state('about', {...})`: This is used to define the `about` state, including the URL, the template URL and the controller.
