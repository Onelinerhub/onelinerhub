# How can I create an AngularJS quiz?
// plain

Creating an AngularJS quiz involves several steps. First, you need to create a controller to handle the quiz logic. This controller will contain the questions, answers, and any other logic needed to handle user input and display results.

Next, you need to create a view for the quiz. This view should contain the HTML elements needed to display the questions and answers. You can also include any additional elements needed to handle user input.

Finally, you need to create a service to handle the data associated with the quiz. This service will be responsible for retrieving questions and answers from a database and passing them to the controller.

Here is an example of a controller for an AngularJS quiz:

```javascript
angular.module('myQuizApp')
  .controller('QuizController', function($scope, QuizService) {
    // Get the questions from the service
    $scope.questions = QuizService.getQuestions();

    // Set the current question
    $scope.currentQuestion = 0;

    // Set the user's answer
    $scope.userAnswer = null;

    // Set the score
    $scope.score = 0;

    // Set the number of questions
    $scope.numberOfQuestions = $scope.questions.length;

    // Check the user's answer
    $scope.checkAnswer = function() {
      if ($scope.userAnswer === $scope.questions[$scope.currentQuestion].correctAnswer) {
        // Increase the score
        $scope.score++;
      }
      // Move to the next question
      $scope.currentQuestion++;
    };
  });
```

Finally, you need to include the necessary HTML elements in the view. For example, you can use the following code to display the questions and answers:

```html
<div ng-repeat="question in questions track by $index">
  <h3>{{question.text}}</h3>
  <div ng-repeat="answer in question.answers track by $index">
    <input type="radio" name="answer" ng-model="userAnswer" value="{{answer}}" />
    {{answer}}
  </div>
  <button ng-click="checkAnswer()">Check Answer</button>
</div>
```
