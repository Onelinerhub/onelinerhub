# How can I use AngularJS to keep my code pristine?
// plain

AngularJS is a powerful, open source JavaScript framework that can be used to keep code clean and organized. One way to do this is to use the built-in dependency injection system to keep your code decoupled and organized. This allows you to easily inject services and other components into your code without having to manually manage dependencies.

Another way to keep your code clean is to use the AngularJS templating system. This allows you to separate your HTML markup from your JavaScript code, making it easier to read and maintain.

Here is an example of how to use the dependency injection system to keep code clean:

```
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .controller('MyController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
    // code using $scope
  }]);
```

The code above creates a new module called `myApp`, and injects the `$scope` service into the `MyController` controller. This allows us to use the `$scope` service without having to manually manage the dependencies between the controller and the service.

Finally, you can also use AngularJS's built-in validation system to keep your code clean and organized. This allows you to easily validate user input and ensure that your code is working as expected.
