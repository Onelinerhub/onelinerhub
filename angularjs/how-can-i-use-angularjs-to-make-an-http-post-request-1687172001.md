# How can I use AngularJS to make an HTTP POST request?
// plain

AngularJS provides a simple way to make an HTTP POST request using the `$http` service. The `$http` service allows us to make an HTTP request to a given URL and pass in data as a parameter.

Below is an example of how to make an HTTP POST request using AngularJS:

```javascript
$http.post('/api/data', {data: 'some data'})
  .then(function(response) {
    // handle success
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function(response) {
    // handle error
    console.log(response);
  });
```

This code block will make an HTTP POST request to the URL `/api/data` and pass in the data `some data` as a parameter. The response object will be passed to the `then` function if the request was successful, or the `catch` function if the request was unsuccessful.

## Code explanation


1. `$http.post('/api/data', {data: 'some data'})` - This is the main command to make an HTTP POST request to the URL `/api/data` and pass in the data `some data` as a parameter.
2. `.then(function(response) { ... })` - This is the callback function that will be called if the request was successful. The response object will be passed to this function.
3. `.catch(function(response) { ... })` - This is the callback function that will be called if the request was unsuccessful. The response object will be passed to this function.
