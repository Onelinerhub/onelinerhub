// plain

AngularJS is a powerful JavaScript framework used to create dynamic web applications. It can be used to implement Material Design, which is a design language developed by Google. Material Design provides a unified system for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices.

To use AngularJS to implement Material Design, you need to include the Angular Material library in your project. You can do this by adding the following code to your HTML page:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angular_material/1.1.0/angular-material.min.js"></script>
```

You will also need to include the Angular Material CSS file in your page, which you can do with the following code:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angular_material/1.1.0/angular-material.min.css">
```

Once you have included the library and the CSS file, you can start using Material Design components in your AngularJS application. For example, you can use the <md-button> component to create a Material Design button, like this:

```
<md-button>Click Me!</md-button>
```

This will create a Material Design button that looks like this:

```
Click Me!
```
