# How do I use the AngularJS link function?
// plain

The `link` function in AngularJS is used to create custom directives. It is invoked after the controller and template are loaded and is used to bind the scope of the directive to the DOM elements.

Here is an example of a directive using the `link` function:

```javascript
app.directive('myDirective', function() {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    templateUrl: 'myDirective.html',
    controller: 'MyDirectiveController',
    link: function (scope, element, attrs) {
      // Bind scope to DOM elements
    }
  };
});
```

The `link` function takes three parameters:

1. **scope** - The scope of the directive.
2. **element** - The DOM element that the directive is attached to.
3. **attrs** - The attributes of the element.

The `link` function is used to bind the scope of the directive to the DOM elements. This allows for data binding and other operations to be performed on the DOM elements.

For more information on the `link` function, see the [AngularJS documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive).
