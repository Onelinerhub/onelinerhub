# How can I use an IDE to develop an AngularJS application?
// plain

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) can be used to develop an AngularJS application. The IDE provides features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and refactoring. Here is an example of using an IDE to create a simple AngularJS application:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
      app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
        $scope.name = "John Doe";
      });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
      <p>{{ name }}</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The output of this code, when run in a browser, would be:

```
John Doe
```

The code is comprised of the following parts:

1. The `<script>` tags that include the AngularJS library and the application code.
2. The `<div>` tag that includes the `ng-app` and `ng-controller` attributes.
3. The `{{ name }}` expression, which is used to display the value of the `name` variable.
