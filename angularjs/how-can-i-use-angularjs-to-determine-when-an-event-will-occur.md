# How can I use AngularJS to determine when an event will occur?
// plain

AngularJS provides various event handlers that can be used to determine when an event will occur. The most commonly used event handler is the `ng-click` directive, which is triggered when an element is clicked.

For example, the following code will display an alert when the button is clicked:

```
<button ng-click="showAlert()">Click Me!</button>

<script>
  function showAlert() {
    alert("Button was clicked!");
  }
</script>
```
When the button is clicked, the following output will be displayed:

```
Button was clicked!
```

Other event handlers that can be used to determine when an event will occur include `ng-change`, `ng-focus`, `ng-blur`, `ng-mouseenter`, `ng-mouseleave`, `ng-keyup`, `ng-keydown`, and `ng-keypress`. All of these event handlers can be used in a similar manner to the `ng-click` directive.
