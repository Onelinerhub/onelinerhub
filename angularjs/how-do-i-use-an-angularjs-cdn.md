# How do I use an AngularJS CDN?
// plain

Using an AngularJS CDN is a great way to include the AngularJS library in your web application.

The following example shows how to include the AngularJS library from a CDN in an HTML document:

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
```

This code will include the AngularJS library from the Google CDN.

The code above consists of the following parts:

* `<script>` - This is an HTML tag that is used to include external JavaScript files.
* `src` - This is an attribute of the `<script>` tag that specifies the URL of the JavaScript file to be included.
* `https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js` - This is the URL of the AngularJS library from the Google CDN.
