How can I restrict access to my AngularJS application?
// plain

You can restrict access to an AngularJS application by using authentication and authorization. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of determining the permissions of the user.

For example, you can use the [AngularJS Auth module](https://github.com/witoldsz/angular-http-auth) to add authentication and authorization to your application. This module provides an `http-auth-interceptor` service, which intercepts all HTTP requests and checks for a valid authentication token. If the token is valid, the request is allowed to proceed, otherwise, the user is redirected to the login page.

```javascript
// Add the http-auth-interceptor to the application
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['http-auth-interceptor']);

// Configure the http-auth-interceptor
app.config(function($httpProvider) {
    $httpProvider.interceptors.push('http-auth-interceptor');
});
```

The module also provides an `authentication` service, which can be used to authenticate a user with a username and password. The service returns a promise, which is resolved if the authentication is successful, otherwise it is rejected:

```javascript
// Authenticate the user with username and password
authentication.authenticate(username, password).then(function() {
    // Authentication successful
}, function() {
    // Authentication failed
});
```

Finally, you can use the `authorization` service to check if a user has the necessary permissions to access a given resource. The service returns a boolean value, indicating if the user is authorized or not:

```javascript
// Check if the user is authorized to access the resource
var isAuthorized = authorization.authorize('resource');
// isAuthorized is true or false
```

By using the AngularJS Auth module, you can easily restrict access to your AngularJS application.
