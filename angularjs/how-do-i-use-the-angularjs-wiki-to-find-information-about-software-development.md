# How do I use the AngularJS Wiki to find information about software development?
// plain

The AngularJS Wiki is a great resource for finding information about software development. It provides comprehensive documentation on the various components of the AngularJS framework, as well as tutorials and example code.

For example, to find information on how to create a simple "Hello World" application using AngularJS, you could use the following code block:

```
<div ng-app="">
  <p>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p>
  <h1>Hello {{name}}!</h1>
</div>
```

This code block will output a "Hello World" application with an input box for the user to enter their name. The output will look like this:

```
Name:
Hello !
```

The code block consists of three parts:
1. The `<div>` element with the `ng-app` attribute set to an empty string. This is used to define the application.
2. The `<input>` element with the `ng-model` attribute set to "name". This binds the input value to the `name` variable.
3. The `<h1>` element with the `{{name}}` interpolation. This displays the value of the `name` variable.
