// plain

The AngularJS documentation is a great resource for developing software with AngularJS. It provides detailed information about the AngularJS framework, including tutorials, examples, and API references.

To get started, you can go through the tutorial section of the documentation, which will give you an overview of the framework and how to use it. It also provides code samples that you can use to start building your application. For example, the following code block shows how to create a simple AngularJS application:

```
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myController">
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>

<script>
  var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
  app.controller('myController', function($scope) {
    $scope.message = 'Hello World!';
  });
</script>
```

The output of the code above is:

```
Hello World!
```

The documentation also contains a comprehensive API reference section, which provides detailed information about all of the components of the AngularJS framework, such as directives, services, filters, and more. You can use this section to look up specific methods and properties.

Finally, the documentation provides a list of helpful resources, such as books, tutorials, and videos, that can help you learn more about using AngularJS.
