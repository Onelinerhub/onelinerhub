# How to add vertical scroll to div

### Suppose we have the following HTML `<div class="scroll-div"></div>`:

```css
.scroll-div {
	width: 100%;
	height: 500px;
	overflow-y: scroll;
}
```

- `.scroll-div` - element which will have vertical scroll
- `overflow-y` - controls how vertical overflow is managed
- `scroll` - will show vertical scrollbar
