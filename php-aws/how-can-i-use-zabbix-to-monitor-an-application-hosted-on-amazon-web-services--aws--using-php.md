// plain

You can use Zabbix to monitor an application hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using PHP by following the steps below:

1. Install the Zabbix agent on the server running the application.
2. Create a PHP script to collect the application's metrics and log them to a file.
3. Configure the Zabbix agent to read the log file created by the PHP script.
4. Use Zabbix's web-based user interface to create a host and a template to monitor the application.
5. Link the host to the template and specify the parameters to be monitored.
6. Configure the Zabbix server to collect the data from the Zabbix agent.
7. Use Zabbix's web-based user interface to visualize the application's performance metrics.

## Example code

```
<?php
// Collect application metrics and log them to a file
$metrics = get_application_metrics();
$log_file = "/var/log/application_metrics.log";
file_put_contents($log_file, json_encode($metrics));
?>
```
