# How can I use AWS, PHP, and MySQL together to develop software?
// plain

AWS, PHP, and MySQL can be used together to develop software by leveraging the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and AWS Relational Database Service (RDS). With EC2, users can launch an instance of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) pre-configured with PHP and MySQL. The EC2 instance can then be used to host the software application. Additionally, RDS can be used to store the data associated with the software application.

For example, the following code snippet can be used to spin up an EC2 instance with PHP and MySQL installed:

```
aws ec2 run-instances \
--image-id ami-a4c7edb2 \
--instance-type t2.micro \
--security-group-ids sg-12345678 \
--subnet-id subnet-12345678 \
--key-name my-key-pair
```

The code snippet above spins up an EC2 instance with the specified AMI, instance type, security group, subnet, and key pair.

To connect to the EC2 instance and install the software application, users can use an SSH client such as Putty. Additionally, the MySQL server can be accessed from the EC2 instance using the MySQL command line client.
