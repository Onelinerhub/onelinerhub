# How do I host a PHP application on AWS?
// plain

1. Create an Amazon EC2 instance. This can be done through the AWS Management Console. Make sure to select an instance type that supports PHP.

2. Connect to the instance using SSH.

3. Install the necessary software, such as the Apache web server, PHP, and MySQL.

4. Configure the web server and PHP to work together.

5. Upload the application files to the instance.

6. Configure the application to work with the database.

7. Test the application to make sure it works.

Example code for connecting to the instance using SSH:

```
ssh -i <path-to-key-file> <username>@<public-dns-name>
```

## Output example


```
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-1045-aws x86_64)

<username>@<public-dns-name>:~$
```

## Code explanation


- `ssh` - the command to use for connecting to the instance
- `-i <path-to-key-file>` - the option to specify the path to the key file
- `<username>` - the username of the user to log in as
- `<public-dns-name>` - the public DNS name of the instance
