# How can I use PHP to develop applications on Amazon Web Services?
// plain

PHP can be used to develop applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS) by leveraging the AWS SDK for PHP. The SDK provides a set of libraries that allow developers to build applications using the AWS platform.

For example, the following code can be used to create an Amazon S3 bucket:
```
<?php
  // Include the SDK using the Composer autoloader
  require 'vendor/autoload.php';

  use Aws\S3\S3Client;

  // Instantiate an Amazon S3 client.
  $s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
  ]);

  // Create a new bucket
  $result = $s3->createBucket([
    'Bucket' => 'my-bucket',
    'ACL' => 'public-read'
  ]);

  // Print the bucket's URL
  echo $result['Location'];
```

The code will create a new S3 bucket with the name "my-bucket" and a public-read ACL.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `require 'vendor/autoload.php'` - This line includes the AWS SDK for PHP.
2. `use Aws\S3\S3Client` - This line imports the S3Client class from the SDK.
3. `$s3 = new S3Client([ ... ])` - This line instantiates an S3Client object.
4. `$result = $s3->createBucket([ ... ])` - This line creates a new S3 bucket.
5. `echo $result['Location']` - This line prints the URL of the newly created bucket.
