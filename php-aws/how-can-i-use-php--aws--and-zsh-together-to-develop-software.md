# How can I use PHP, AWS, and ZSH together to develop software?
// plain

PHP, AWS, and ZSH can be used together to develop software by leveraging the capabilities of each. For example, PHP can be used to write the code for the software, AWS can be used to host the software, and ZSH can be used to manage the software's environment.

To demonstrate, consider the following code block written in PHP:
```
<?php
    echo "Hello World";
?>
```
This code will output the following:
```
Hello World
```

To deploy this code on AWS, the code must be uploaded to an EC2 instance, which can be done with ZSH. To do this, the following command can be used:

```
scp -i <path_to_key_file> <path_to_file> <ec2_username>@<ec2_hostname>:<path_to_upload_location>
```

This command will securely copy the file to the EC2 instance. Once the file is uploaded, the code can be executed by navigating to the file's location on the EC2 instance.
