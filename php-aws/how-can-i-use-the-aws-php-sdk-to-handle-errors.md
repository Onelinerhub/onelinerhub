# How can I use the AWS PHP SDK to handle errors?
// plain

To handle errors with the AWS PHP SDK, you can use the `try` and `catch` block. The `try` block contains the code that may throw an exception and the `catch` block contains the code that will handle the exception.

For example:
```
try {
    $result = $s3Client->getObject([
        'Bucket' => 'my-bucket',
        'Key' => 'my-key'
    ]);
    echo $result['Body'];
} catch (AwsException $e) {
    // output error message if fails
    echo $e->getMessage();
    echo "\n";
}
```

The code above will try to get the object from the S3 bucket and echo its contents. If it fails, it will output the error message.

Besides using the `try` and `catch` block, you can also use the `Aws\HandlerList` to add middleware that will be triggered when an error occurs.

For example:
```
$stack = HandlerList::create();
$stack->push(Middleware::retry(), 'retry');
$s3Client = new S3Client([
    'handler' => $stack
]);
```

The code above will add a retry middleware to the stack.

You can find more information about handling errors in the [AWS PHP SDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/guide/guide/error-handling.html).
