# How can I use PHP and AWS together to develop software?
// plain

PHP and AWS can be used together to develop software in several ways.

1. **Deployment with Elastic Beanstalk**: Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you can deploy and manage your PHP applications quickly and easily. Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.

2. **Database with RDS**: AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) allows you to easily set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It supports several database engines, including MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

3. **Object Storage with S3**: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. You can use S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

4. **Serverless with Lambda**: AWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can use Lambda to run your PHP code in response to events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table.

## Example code

```php
<?php
// Create an S3 client
$s3Client = new Aws\S3\S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
]);

// Upload a file
$result = $s3Client->putObject([
    'Bucket' => 'my-bucket',
    'Key'    => 'my-file.txt',
    'Body'   => 'This is the file contents.'
]);

// Print the URL to the object
echo $result['ObjectURL'] . "\n";
```
## Output example

```
https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/my-file.txt
```

## Code explanation

* `$s3Client = new Aws\S3\S3Client([`: This line creates a new S3 client using the AWS SDK for PHP.
* `'Bucket' => 'my-bucket'`: This line specifies the name of the S3 bucket to use.
* `$result = $s3Client->putObject([`: This line uploads a file to the specified S3 bucket.
* `echo $result['ObjectURL']`: This line prints the URL to the uploaded object.
