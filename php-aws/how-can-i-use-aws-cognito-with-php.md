# How can I use AWS Cognito with PHP?
// plain

You can use AWS Cognito with PHP by utilizing the AWS SDK for PHP. The SDK provides a set of classes that allow you to interact with AWS services, including Cognito.

For example, you can use the `CognitoIdentityProviderClient` class to authenticate users with Cognito. The following code snippet shows how to authenticate a user with their username and password:

```php
<?php

use Aws\CognitoIdentityProvider\CognitoIdentityProviderClient;

$client = new CognitoIdentityProviderClient([
    'region' => 'us-east-1',
    'version' => 'latest'
]);

$result = $client->adminInitiateAuth([
    'AuthFlow' => 'ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH',
    'ClientId' => '<CLIENT_ID>',
    'UserPoolId' => '<USER_POOL_ID>',
    'AuthParameters' => [
        'USERNAME' => '<USERNAME>',
        'PASSWORD' => '<PASSWORD>',
    ],
]);

print_r($result);

```

The output of the above code will be an array of data about the authenticated user, such as their ID and access token.

## Code explanation


1. `CognitoIdentityProviderClient`: This is the class from the AWS SDK for PHP that allows you to interact with Cognito.

2. `Aws\CognitoIdentityProvider\CognitoIdentityProviderClient`: This is the namespace for the `CognitoIdentityProviderClient` class.

3. `AuthFlow`: This is a parameter that specifies the authentication flow to use. In this case, we are using `ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`, which is an authentication flow for administrators that does not require a secure remote password (SRP).

4. `ClientId`: This is the client ID of your Cognito application.

5. `UserPoolId`: This is the ID of the user pool that you are authenticating against.

6. `AuthParameters`: This is an array of parameters that are used to authenticate the user. In this case, we are using `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`.

7. `print_r($result)`: This is used to print out the result of the authentication request.
