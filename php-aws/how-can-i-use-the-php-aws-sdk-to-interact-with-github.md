# How can I use the PHP AWS SDK to interact with GitHub?
// plain

The PHP AWS SDK can be used to interact with GitHub by using the AWS CodeCommit service. AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that makes it easy for developers to host secure and highly scalable private Git repositories.

In order to use the PHP AWS SDK to interact with GitHub, you will need to have an AWS account and the AWS CLI installed. Once those are set up, you can use the following code to connect to GitHub:

```php
$client = new Aws\CodeCommit\CodeCommitClient([
    'region' => 'us-east-1',
    'version' => '2015-04-13',
]);
```

Once the client is created, you can use it to interact with GitHub in various ways, such as creating, updating, or deleting repositories, or getting a list of existing repositories. For example, the following code can be used to get a list of existing repositories:

```php
$result = $client->listRepositories([
    'sortBy' => 'repositoryName',
    'order' => 'ascending',
]);

foreach ($result['repositories'] as $repo) {
    print_r($repo);
}
```

The output of the above code will be an array of repository objects, containing the repository name, ARN, and other details.

## Code explanation


1. `$client = new Aws\CodeCommit\CodeCommitClient([` - This line creates an instance of the CodeCommitClient class, which is used to interact with the CodeCommit service.

2. `'region' => 'us-east-1',` - This specifies the region in which the CodeCommit service is running.

3. `'version' => '2015-04-13',` - This specifies the version of the CodeCommit service that will be used.

4. `$result = $client->listRepositories([` - This line calls the listRepositories method on the CodeCommitClient object, which is used to get a list of existing repositories.

5. `'sortBy' => 'repositoryName',` - This specifies the field by which the list of repositories should be sorted.

6. `'order' => 'ascending',` - This specifies the order in which the list of repositories should be sorted.

7. `foreach ($result['repositories'] as $repo) {` - This loop iterates through the list of repositories returned by the listRepositories method.
