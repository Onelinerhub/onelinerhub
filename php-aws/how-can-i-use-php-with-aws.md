# How can I use PHP with AWS?
// plain

Using PHP with AWS is an easy and efficient way to create applications that can interact with the cloud.

You can use the AWS SDK for PHP to easily integrate your application with AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon SES.

## Example code

```
<?php
// Include the SDK using the Composer autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$s3 = new Aws\S3\S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-west-2'
]);

$result = $s3->listBuckets();

foreach ($result['Buckets'] as $bucket) {
    echo $bucket['Name'] . "\n";
}
```

## Output example

```
my-bucket-1
my-bucket-2
```

## Code explanation

- `require 'vendor/autoload.php';`: This line includes the AWS SDK for PHP.
- `$s3 = new Aws\S3\S3Client([])`: This line creates a new instance of the S3Client class.
- `$result = $s3->listBuckets();`: This line calls the listBuckets() method to list all the buckets in the account.
- `foreach ($result['Buckets'] as $bucket)`: This line loops through the buckets in the result array.
- `echo $bucket['Name'] . "\n";`: This line prints out the name of each bucket.
