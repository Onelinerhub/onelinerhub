# How can I use PHP, AWS, and Composer together to develop software?
// plain

PHP, AWS, and Composer can be used together to develop software by leveraging the power of each technology.

First, you can use AWS to host your application. AWS provides a wide range of services to help you build and manage your application, such as EC2, S3, and Lambda.

Second, you can use Composer to manage your application dependencies. Composer is a PHP package manager that allows you to easily install and update libraries and packages.

Third, you can use PHP to write the code for your application. PHP is a popular server-side scripting language that is used to build dynamic websites and applications.

For example, you can use the following code to create a simple web page using PHP, AWS, and Composer:

```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\S3\S3Client;

$s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
]);

echo "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";

?>

```
This code will output the following:
```
Hello World!
```

## Code explanation


1. `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'` - This line of code uses Composer to include the necessary libraries and packages for the application.

2. `use Aws\S3\S3Client;` - This line of code imports the S3Client class from the AWS SDK for PHP.

3. `$s3 = new S3Client([...])` - This line of code creates an instance of the S3Client class.

4. `echo "<h1>Hello World!</h1>"` - This line of code outputs the "Hello World!" message on the web page.
