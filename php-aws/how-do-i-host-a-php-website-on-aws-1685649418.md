# How do I host a PHP website on AWS?
// plain

To host a PHP website on AWS, you will need to use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This will provide you with a virtual server on which you can install your web server software such as Apache or Nginx.

To get started, you will need to create an EC2 instance and configure it to run your web server software. For example, you can use the following code to create a new EC2 instance using the AWS CLI:

```
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <AMI ID> --instance-type <Instance Type>
```

Once the instance is created, you will need to install the web server software, configure it to serve your PHP application, and enable HTTPS. You can do this by following the instructions provided by the web server software vendor.

You will also need to configure your EC2 instance to allow incoming traffic to your website. This can be done by setting up a security group and adding the appropriate rules. For example, the following code will allow incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP):

```
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <SG ID> --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

Once your EC2 instance is configured, you can use an Elastic IP address to make your website accessible on the internet.

To learn more about hosting a PHP website on AWS, you can refer to the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html).
