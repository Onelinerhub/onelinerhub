# How can I use PHP, AWS, and GitHub together to develop software?
// plain

PHP, AWS, and GitHub can be used together to develop software in a variety of ways. First, you can use PHP to create the code for the software, which can then be stored in a GitHub repository. The code can then be deployed to an AWS server, where it can be tested and run.

An example of this process would be to create a simple PHP script that prints "Hello World!" to the screen:
```
<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>
```
## Output example

```
Hello World!
```

This code can be stored in a GitHub repository, and then deployed to an AWS server. Once the code is on the server, it can be tested and run.

The process of using PHP, AWS, and GitHub together to develop software can also be automated. This can be done by using a variety of tools such as Jenkins, CircleCI, or TravisCI. These tools can be configured to automatically deploy code from a GitHub repository to an AWS server whenever changes are made.
