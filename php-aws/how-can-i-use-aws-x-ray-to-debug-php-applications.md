# How can I use AWS X-Ray to debug PHP applications?
// plain

AWS X-Ray is a distributed tracing system that allows developers to debug and analyze their applications. It can be used to debug PHP applications by tracing requests and responses between the application and its dependencies and visualizing them in the X-Ray console.

To use X-Ray with a PHP application, you need to install the AWS X-Ray SDK for PHP. The SDK provides an API for instrumenting your application to send data to X-Ray.

For example, the following code uses the SDK to send data to X-Ray about an incoming request:
```
<?php
use Aws\XRay\XRayClient;

$xray = new XRayClient([
    'region' => 'us-east-1',
    'version' => 'latest',
]);

$xray->beginSegment('my_php_app');
$xray->endSegment();
```

This code will create a segment in X-Ray that contains information about the incoming request. The segment can be used to trace requests and responses between the application and its dependencies, and visualize them in the X-Ray console.

The SDK also provides APIs for adding annotations and metadata to segments, which can be used to add additional information about the request.

- Install the AWS X-Ray SDK for PHP
- Use the SDK to instrument your application to send data to X-Ray
- Create a segment in X-Ray that contains information about the incoming request
- Trace requests and responses between the application and its dependencies
- Visualize the data in the X-Ray console
- Use annotations and metadata to add additional information
