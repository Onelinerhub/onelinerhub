# How can I use PHP in Amazon Web Services (AWS)?
// plain

PHP can be used in Amazon Web Services (AWS) in several ways.

Firstly, you can use Elastic Beanstalk to deploy and manage your PHP applications. Elastic Beanstalk provides a platform for deploying and scaling applications written in PHP. It also provides a managed environment so you don't have to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.

Secondly, you can use Amazon Lightsail to deploy a preconfigured virtual machine with PHP pre-installed. Lightsail also provides a managed environment and you can easily deploy your PHP applications on it.

Thirdly, you can use AWS Lambda to run your PHP code. Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. You can upload your PHP code as a Lambda function and run it whenever needed.

Here is an example of a simple PHP script that prints "Hello World" using AWS Lambda:

```
<?php
  echo "Hello World";
?>
```
## Output example
 `Hello World`

The code consists of two parts:
1. `<?php` - This is the opening tag, which indicates the beginning of the PHP code.
2. `echo "Hello World";` - This line prints the string "Hello World" to the output.
