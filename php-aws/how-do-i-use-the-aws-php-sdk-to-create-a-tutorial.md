# How do I use the AWS PHP SDK to create a tutorial?
// plain

Using the AWS PHP SDK to create a tutorial requires the following steps:

1. Install the AWS PHP SDK using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```
composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
```
2. Create a file to hold your tutorial, such as `tutorial.php`.
3. Include the AWS PHP SDK in your tutorial file:
```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
4. Create an AWS service object, such as an Amazon S3 client:
```php
$s3Client = new Aws\S3\S3Client([
    'region'  => 'us-east-1',
    'version' => 'latest'
]);
```
5. Use the service object to perform desired operations in your tutorial:
```php
$result = $s3Client->listBuckets();

echo "Buckets:\n";
foreach ($result['Buckets'] as $bucket) {
    echo $bucket['Name'] . "\n";
}
```
6. Output:
```
Buckets:
my-bucket
other-bucket
```
