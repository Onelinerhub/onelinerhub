# How can I use AWS X-Ray to debug a PHP application?
// plain

AWS X-Ray is a distributed tracing service that allows developers to debug, analyze, and troubleshoot applications by collecting data about requests and responses. To debug a PHP application using AWS X-Ray, you need to first install the AWS X-Ray SDK for PHP.

Once the SDK is installed, you can instrument your application code with the SDK, which will send data to the X-Ray service. For example, the following code shows how to instrument a PHP application to send a trace to X-Ray:

```php
<?php
use Aws\XRay\XRayClient;

$xray = new XRayClient([
    'region' => 'us-west-2',
    'version' => 'latest'
]);

$segment = $xray->beginSegment('MyApp');

// Your application code here

$xray->endSegment($segment);
?>
```

The code above will create a segment in X-Ray and send data about your application requests and responses to X-Ray. You can then use the X-Ray service to view and analyze the data, which will help you identify any issues or performance bottlenecks in your application.

For more information about using AWS X-Ray to debug a PHP application, see the [AWS X-Ray documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-php.html).
