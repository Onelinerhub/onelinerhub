# How can I use the PHP AWS Client to access AWS services?
// plain

The PHP AWS Client is a library of classes that allow developers to interact with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. It provides access to a wide range of AWS services, including Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon DynamoDB.

Using the PHP AWS Client is relatively straightforward. First, you will need to install the AWS SDK for PHP and configure your credentials. After that, you can use the client to access AWS services.

For example, to list all of the objects in an S3 bucket, you can use the following code:
```
<?php
// Include the AWS SDK
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Create an S3 client
$s3 = new Aws\S3\S3Client([
    'region'  => 'us-east-1',
    'version' => '2006-03-01'
]);

// List all of the objects in a bucket
$objects = $s3->listObjects([
    'Bucket' => 'my-bucket'
]);

foreach ($objects['Contents'] as $object) {
    echo $object['Key'] . "\n";
}

```

This code will output a list of all of the objects in the `my-bucket` S3 bucket:
```
my-file.txt
my-image.jpg
...
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `require 'vendor/autoload.php';` - This line includes the AWS SDK for PHP.
2. `$s3 = new Aws\S3\S3Client([ ... ]);` - This line creates an S3 client, which is used to interact with S3 buckets.
3. `$objects = $s3->listObjects([ ... ]);` - This line lists all of the objects in the S3 bucket.
4. `foreach ($objects['Contents'] as $object) { ... }` - This loop iterates over the list of objects and prints out the object key.
