# How can I use the PHP AWS library to achieve my software development goals?
// plain

The PHP AWS library is a great tool for helping you achieve your software development goals. It provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. The library includes a variety of classes and methods that allow developers to access and manipulate AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and DynamoDB tables.

Here is an example of using the library to list all of your EC2 instances:

```php
<?php

$ec2Client = new \Aws\Ec2\Ec2Client([
    'region' => 'us-east-1',
    'version' => 'latest'
]);

$result = $ec2Client->describeInstances();

foreach ($result['Reservations'] as $reservation) {
    foreach ($reservation['Instances'] as $instance) {
        echo $instance['InstanceId'] . "\n";
    }
}

```

## Output example

```
i-12345678
i-87654321
```

The code above creates an Ec2Client object, which is used to call the `describeInstances` method. This method returns an array of information about all of the EC2 instances associated with the current AWS account. The code then iterates over the array and prints out the instance IDs.
