# How can I use PHP and AWS Boto to develop software?
// plain

PHP and AWS Boto can be used together to develop software by leveraging the power of cloud computing.

For example, the following code can be used to connect to an Amazon S3 bucket:
```
// Include the SDK using the Composer autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Instantiate an Amazon S3 client.
$s3 = new Aws\S3\S3Client([
    'version'     => 'latest',
    'region'      => 'us-east-1',
    'credentials' => [
        'key'    => 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
        'secret' => 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    ]
]);
```

## Code explanation

1. `require 'vendor/autoload.php';` - This includes the SDK using the Composer autoloader.
2. `$s3 = new Aws\S3\S3Client([` - This instantiates an Amazon S3 client.
3. `'version'     => 'latest',` - This sets the version of the SDK to the latest.
4. `'region'      => 'us-east-1',` - This sets the AWS region to `us-east-1`.
5. `'credentials' => [` - This sets the credentials for the AWS account.
6. `'key'    => 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',` - This sets the AWS access key ID.
7. `'secret' => 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',` - This sets the AWS secret access key.
