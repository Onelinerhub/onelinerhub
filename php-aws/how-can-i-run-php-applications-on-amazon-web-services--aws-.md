# How can I run PHP applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS)?
// plain

You can run PHP applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using EC2 instances. EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

To run PHP applications on AWS, you need to:

1. Create an Amazon EC2 instance to run your PHP application.

2. Install the necessary web server and database software on your instance.

3. Install and configure the PHP interpreter on your instance.

4. Upload your PHP application code to the instance.

5. Configure your web server to serve the PHP application.

Here is an example of how to install and configure the Apache web server and PHP interpreter on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance:

```
# Install Apache
sudo yum install httpd

# Start the Apache service
sudo service httpd start

# Install PHP
sudo yum install php php-mysql

# Restart the Apache service
sudo service httpd restart
```

Once you have installed and configured the web server and PHP interpreter, you can upload your PHP application code to the instance and configure your web server to serve the application.
