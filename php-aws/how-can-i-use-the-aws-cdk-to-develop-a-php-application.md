# How can I use the AWS CDK to develop a PHP application?
// plain

The AWS CDK is a software development framework for creating cloud applications using programming languages. It enables developers to define cloud infrastructure using code, and provides a number of tools and libraries for developing and deploying applications to the cloud.

To use the AWS CDK to develop a PHP application, you will need to create a CDK stack and define the resources needed for the application. The following code example shows how to create a stack and define a VPC, EC2 instance, and S3 bucket:

```
const app = new cdk.App();
const stack = new cdk.Stack(app, "MyStack");

// Create a VPC
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(stack, "MyVpc", {
  cidr: "10.0.0.0/16"
});

// Create an EC2 instance
const instance = new ec2.Instance(stack, "MyInstance", {
  vpc,
  instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(
    ec2.InstanceClass.T2,
    ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO
  )
});

// Create an S3 bucket
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(stack, "MyBucket", {
  versioned: true
});
```

Once the resources are defined, you can use the AWS CDK to deploy the application to the cloud. You can use the AWS CLI to deploy the application, or use the AWS CDK command line tool to deploy the application.

To deploy the application, you will need to install the AWS CDK and configure the AWS CLI. After that, you can run the following command to deploy the application:

```
cdk deploy
```

The AWS CDK will then deploy the application to the cloud and configure the resources needed for the application.
