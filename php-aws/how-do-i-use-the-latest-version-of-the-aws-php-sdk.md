# How do I use the latest version of the AWS PHP SDK?
// plain

The AWS PHP SDK is a library that allows developers to access and manage AWS services from their PHP applications. The latest version of the SDK can be installed and used via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), a dependency manager for PHP.

To install the latest version of the AWS PHP SDK using Composer, you can run the following command:

```
composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
```

This command will install the latest version of the SDK and its dependencies.

Once the SDK is installed, you can use it in your PHP application by including the autoloader file in your code:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

You can then use the SDK to access and manage AWS services. For example, you can use the SDK to create an Amazon S3 client:

```php
$s3 = new Aws\S3\S3Client([
    'region'  => 'us-west-2',
    'version' => 'latest'
]);
```

Once you have a client, you can use it to make requests to AWS services, such as listing the contents of a bucket:

```php
$result = $s3->listBuckets();

foreach ($result['Buckets'] as $bucket) {
    echo $bucket['Name'] . "\n";
}
```

This example code will output a list of bucket names associated with the AWS account.
