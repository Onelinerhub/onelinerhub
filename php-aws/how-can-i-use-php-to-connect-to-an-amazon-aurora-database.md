# How can I use PHP to connect to an Amazon Aurora database?
// plain

You can use PHP to connect to an Amazon Aurora database by using the PHP Data Objects (PDO) library. The PDO library provides a data-access abstraction layer, which means that instead of writing code to access a specific database, you can use the same code to connect to any database that supports PDO.

The following example code shows how to connect to an Amazon Aurora database using PDO:
```
<?php
$dbhost = "aurora-endpoint.amazonaws.com";
$dbname = "mydb";
$dbuser = "myuser";
$dbpass = "mypass";

try {
  $pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=$dbhost;dbname=$dbname", $dbuser, $dbpass);
  echo "Connected to Aurora successfully";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
  echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
}
?>
```
## Output example
 `Connected to Aurora successfully`

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. The database host, username, password, and database name are set as variables.
2. A PDO object is created with the database host, username, password, and database name.
3. If the connection is successful, a message is printed.
4. If the connection fails, an error message is printed.
