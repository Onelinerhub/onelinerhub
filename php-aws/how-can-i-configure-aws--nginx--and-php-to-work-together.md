# How can I configure AWS, Nginx, and PHP to work together?
// plain

1. Configure AWS: Create an EC2 instance and select the appropriate instance type for your application. Then, configure the security group to allow incoming traffic on port 80.

2. Install Nginx: Install Nginx on your EC2 instance using the following command: ```sudo apt-get install nginx```.

3. Configure Nginx: Create a configuration file for your website in /etc/nginx/sites-available. For example:

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com;
  root /var/www/example.com;
  index index.php index.html;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
  }
}
```

4. Enable the Nginx configuration: Create a symbolic link to the configuration file in the sites-enabled directory: ```sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```

5. Install PHP: Install PHP on your EC2 instance using the following command: ```sudo apt-get install php7.0-fpm```

6. Restart Nginx: Restart Nginx to apply the configuration: ```sudo service nginx restart```

7. Test: Test the configuration by creating a file called test.php in the root directory of your website with the following content: ```<?php phpinfo(); ?>```. Then, open http://example.com/test.php in a web browser and you should see the PHP information page.
