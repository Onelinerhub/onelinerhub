Updating a WordPress website hosted on AWS using PHP requires a few steps. First, you need to connect to the server using SSH. Then, you need to navigate to the WordPress directory where the files are stored. For example, if you are using an Amazon Linux instance, the files will be located in `/var/www/html/`.

Once you are in the WordPress directory, you can run the following command to update WordPress:
```
sudo wp core update
```
This will update WordPress to the latest version.

You may also need to update the plugins and themes associated with the WordPress website. This can be done using the following command:
```
sudo wp plugin update --all
sudo wp theme update --all
```

These commands will update all plugins and themes associated with the WordPress website.

Finally, you may need to restart the web server for the changes to take effect. This can be done using the following command:
```
sudo service httpd restart
```

This will restart the web server, allowing the changes to take effect.

To summarize, updating a WordPress website hosted on AWS using PHP requires the following steps:
1. Connect to the server using SSH.
2. Navigate to the WordPress directory.
3. Run `sudo wp core update` to update WordPress.
4. Run `sudo wp plugin update --all` and `sudo wp theme update --all` to update plugins and themes.
5. Run `sudo service httpd restart` to restart the web server.
