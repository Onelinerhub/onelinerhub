# How can I use AWS EventBridge with PHP?
// plain

AWS EventBridge is an event bus service that makes it easy to connect applications together using data from your own applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. You can use EventBridge with PHP to create and manage events from your application.

The AWS SDK for PHP provides an API for interacting with EventBridge. To use EventBridge with PHP, you will need to install the AWS SDK for PHP and configure your credentials.

Once the SDK is installed, you can create and manage events with the following code:

```php
// Create an EventBridge Client
$client = new Aws\EventBridge\EventBridgeClient([
    'region'  => 'us-west-2',
    'version' => '2015-10-07'
]);

// Create an event
$result = $client->putEvents([
    'Entries' => [
        [
            'Detail' => '{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}',
            'DetailType' => 'MyDetailType',
            'Source' => 'MyApp',
            'Time' => time(),
        ],
    ],
]);

// Print the ID of the new event
echo $result['Entries'][0]['EventId'];
```

The output of the above code will be a unique identifier for the new event.

You can also use the EventBridge API to list, describe, and delete events. For more information on using EventBridge with PHP, see the [AWS SDK for PHP EventBridge documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/class-Aws.EventBridge.EventBridgeClient.html).
