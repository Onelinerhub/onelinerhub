# How can I use PHP with AWS?
// plain

PHP can be used with AWS in a variety of ways. The most common methods are using AWS Lambda functions, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon EC2, and Amazon S3.

**Using AWS Lambda**

AWS Lambda functions allow you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can write your PHP code in a Lambda function and invoke it via an API call.

## Example code

```
<?php
$response = array(
    'statusCode' => 200,
    'body' => 'Hello World!'
);
return $response;
```

## Output example

```
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "Hello World!"
}
```

**Using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk**

Amazon Elastic Beanstalk is a service that allows you to quickly deploy and manage web applications. It supports a variety of languages, including PHP. You can upload your PHP code to Elastic Beanstalk and it will automatically provision the necessary resources and deploy your application.

**Using Amazon EC2**

Amazon EC2 is a service that allows you to launch virtual servers in the cloud. You can install a web server such as Apache or Nginx, and then install PHP and your web application on the server.

**Using Amazon S3**

Amazon S3 is a service for storing and retrieving files in the cloud. You can use it to store your PHP code, and then use AWS Lambda to execute the code.
