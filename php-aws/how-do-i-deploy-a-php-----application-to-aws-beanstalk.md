# How do I deploy a PHP 8.1 application to AWS Beanstalk?
// plain

Deploying a PHP 8.1 application to AWS Beanstalk can be done in a few simple steps.

1. Create the application on AWS Beanstalk.
2. Create an environment for the application, specifying the runtime as PHP 8.1.
3. Upload the application code to the environment.
4. Configure the environment to use the code.

For example, the following code can be used to create an environment for a PHP 8.1 application on AWS Beanstalk:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \
  --application-name my-app \
  --environment-name my-env \
  --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2 v4.0.0 running PHP 8.1"
```

This will return the following output:

```
{
    "EnvironmentName": "my-env",
    "EnvironmentId": "e-abcdefghij",
    "ApplicationName": "my-app",
    "VersionLabel": "",
    "SolutionStackName": "64bit Amazon Linux 2 v4.0.0 running PHP 8.1",
    "PlatformArn": "arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:us-east-1::platform/64bit Amazon Linux 2 v4.0.0 running PHP 8.1",
    "TemplateName": "",
    "Description": "",
    "EndpointURL": "",
    "CNAME": "",
    "DateCreated": "2020-08-05T03:17:51.936Z",
    "DateUpdated": "2020-08-05T03:17:51.936Z",
    "Status": "Launching",
    "AbortableOperationInProgress": false,
    "Health": "Grey",
    "HealthStatus": "Unknown",
    "Resources": {
        "LoadBalancer": {
            "LoadBalancerName": "",
            "Domain": "",
            "Listeners": []
        }
    }
}
```

Once the environment is created, the application code can be uploaded and the environment can be configured to use the code.
