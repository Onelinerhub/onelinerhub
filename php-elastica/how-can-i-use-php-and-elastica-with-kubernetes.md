# How can I use PHP and Elastica with Kubernetes?
// plain

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that can be used to deploy and manage applications on a cluster of nodes. It is an ideal platform for running applications written in PHP and Elastica.

Using Kubernetes, you can create a cluster of nodes to host your application. You can then deploy your application using the Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`. For example, to deploy a PHP application with Elastica, you can use the following command:

```
$ kubectl create deployment php-app --image=my-php-image
```

This will create a deployment for your application and deploy it to the cluster nodes. You can then configure the application using environment variables, as well as configure the Elastica cluster using the `kubectl` command-line tool.

Once the application is running on the cluster, you can monitor its performance using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. You can also configure the application using configuration files such as `config.yaml` or `values.yaml`.

Finally, you can use Kubernetes to scale the application up or down, depending on the load. This can be done using the `kubectl` command-line tool, or through the Kubernetes dashboard.

## Example code

```
$ kubectl scale deployment php-app --replicas=3
```

## Output example

```
deployment.extensions/php-app scaled
```

## Code explanation

- `kubectl create deployment php-app --image=my-php-image`: Creates a deployment for your application and deploys it to the cluster nodes.
- `kubectl scale deployment php-app --replicas=3`: Scales the application up or down, depending on the load.
