# How can I use PHP and Elastica to deploy applications on Kubernetes?
// plain

Using PHP and Elastica to deploy applications on Kubernetes is quite simple. To do so, first you need to setup your Kubernetes cluster. After that, you need to create a deployment file in YAML format. This file will define the deployment configuration for your application.

For example, the following deployment file will define a deployment of an Elasticsearch cluster on Kubernetes:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: elasticsearch
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: elasticsearch
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: elasticsearch
        image: elasticsearch:7.6.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9200
```

Once the deployment file is created, you can use PHP and Elastica to deploy the application to Kubernetes. To do this, you need to use the [Kubernetes API Client for PHP](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/php). This client provides a set of PHP classes that can be used to interact with the Kubernetes API.

The following example code will deploy the application defined in the deployment file above:

```php
use Kubernetes\Client\Adapter\Guzzle\Client;
use Kubernetes\Client\Model\KubernetesObject;

$client = new Client();
$kubernetesObject = KubernetesObject::fromFile('deployment.yml');
$client->apply($kubernetesObject);
```

Once the application is deployed, you can use Elastica to manage and monitor the application.
