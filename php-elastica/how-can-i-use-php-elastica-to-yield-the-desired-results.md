# How can I use PHP Elastica to yield the desired results?
// plain

PHP Elastica is a PHP client library for the Elasticsearch search engine. It can be used to query, index, and manage data stored in Elasticsearch.

Using PHP Elastica, you can yield the desired results by following these steps:

1. Create a new instance of the Elastica\Client class, passing in the Elasticsearch host and port.

```
$client = new \Elastica\Client(array('host' => '127.0.0.1', 'port' => 9200));
```

2. Create a new instance of the Elastica\Index class, passing in the client instance and the name of the index.

```
$index = $client->getIndex('my_index');
```

3. Create a new instance of the Elastica\Type class, passing in the index instance and the name of the type.

```
$type = $index->getType('my_type');
```

4. Create a new instance of the Elastica\Query class.

```
$query = new \Elastica\Query();
```

5. Use the addQuery method to add a query to the query object.

```
$query->addQuery(new \Elastica\Query\MatchAll());
```

6. Use the search method of the type instance to execute the query and get the desired results.

```
$results = $type->search($query);
```

7. The results will be returned as an instance of the Elastica\ResultSet class, which contains an array of Elastica\Result objects.
