# How can I use the PHP Elastica Key to search for data?
// plain

The PHP Elastica Key is a powerful tool for searching data stored in an Elasticsearch index. It allows you to query the index for specific data, and then return the results in a structured format.

To use the PHP Elastica Key, you first need to include the library in your project. You can do this with the following code:
```
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

Once the library is included, you can create an instance of the Elastica Client and use it to create a search query. For example, the following code will search for documents with the term “Elastica” in their title:
```
$client = new Elastica\Client();
$query = new Elastica\Query();
$termQuery = new Elastica\Query\Term();
$termQuery->setTerm('title', 'Elastica');
$query->setQuery($termQuery);
$results = $client->search($query);
```

The results of the search query will be returned in a structured format, which you can then use to display the relevant data.

The following list contains parts of the code used in the example above:

- `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';`: This includes the Elastica library in your project.
- `$client = new Elastica\Client();`: This creates an instance of the Elastica Client.
- `$query = new Elastica\Query();`: This creates a new search query.
- `$termQuery = new Elastica\Query\Term();`: This creates a term query, which is used to search for specific terms in documents.
- `$termQuery->setTerm('title', 'Elastica');`: This sets the term to search for in the documents.
- `$query->setQuery($termQuery);`: This sets the query to use when searching.
- `$results = $client->search($query);`: This executes the search query and returns the results.
