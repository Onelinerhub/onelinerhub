# How can I use Apache and Elastica together to develop a PHP application?
// plain

Apache and Elasticsearch can be used together to develop a PHP application by using [Elastica](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica) - a PHP client for Elasticsearch.

For example, to search for documents in an Elasticsearch index, you can use the following code:

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \Elastica\Client();

$index = $client->getIndex('my_index');
$query = new \Elastica\Query\MatchAll();
$resultSet = $index->search($query);

$totalHits = $resultSet->getTotalHits();
echo 'Total hits: ' . $totalHits;

```

The code above will output the total number of documents in the `my_index` index.

To further explain how the code works:

1. The `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'` statement includes the Elastica library.
2. The `$client` variable is an instance of the `Elastica\Client` class.
3. The `$index` variable is an instance of the `Elastica\Index` class, which represents the `my_index` index.
4. The `$query` variable is an instance of the `Elastica\Query\MatchAll` class, which is used to search for all documents in the index.
5. The `$resultSet` variable is an instance of the `Elastica\ResultSet` class, which contains the search results.
6. The `$totalHits` variable is an integer that contains the total number of documents that matched the query.
7. The `echo` statement outputs the total number of documents in the index.
