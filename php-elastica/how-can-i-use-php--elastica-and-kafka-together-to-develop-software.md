# How can I use PHP, Elastica and Kafka together to develop software?
// plain

Using PHP, Elastica and Kafka together to develop software requires a few steps.

1. Install and configure the necessary software components. This includes installing PHP, Elastica and Kafka, and configuring them to work together.

2. Create a PHP application that interacts with the Elastica and Kafka components. This could include a simple script that queries Elastica for data and sends it to Kafka for processing.

3. Write code to process the data from Kafka. This could include a custom function to process the data and store it in a database.

4. Create a web interface to display the processed data. This could include a simple HTML page that displays the data in a table or graph format.

5. Test and debug the application. This could include setting up test cases and running them to make sure the application works as expected.

## Example code

```
<?php
$client = new Elastica\Client();
$query = new Elastica\Query();
$resultSet = $client->search($query);

$producer = new Kafka\Producer();
$producer->send(array(
    'topic' => 'mytopic',
    'message' => $resultSet
));

echo "Data sent successfully to Kafka";
```

Output of example code:
```
Data sent successfully to Kafka
```
