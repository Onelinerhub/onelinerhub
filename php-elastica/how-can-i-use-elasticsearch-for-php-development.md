# How can I use Elasticsearch for PHP development?
// plain

Elasticsearch can be used for PHP development to enable powerful search capabilities for applications. It is an open source search engine based on Apache Lucene.

To use Elasticsearch for PHP development, you will need to install the Elasticsearch PHP client library. This can be done with Composer:
```
composer require elasticsearch/elasticsearch
```

Once the library is installed, you can use it to connect to an Elasticsearch cluster and perform various operations. For example, you can search for documents in an index:
```php
$params = [
    'index' => 'my_index',
    'body' => [
        'query' => [
            'match' => [
                'title' => 'Elasticsearch'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
$results = $client->search($params);
```

The code above will search for documents in the `my_index` index that contain the term `Elasticsearch` in the `title` field. The results of the search will be stored in the `$results` variable.

For more information on using Elasticsearch for PHP development, see the [Elasticsearch PHP Client documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/index.html).
