# How can I resolve a "PHP Elastica Not Found" error?
// plain

The "PHP Elastica Not Found" error is an issue that can occur when using the Elasticsearch PHP client library, Elastica. It usually indicates that the client is unable to connect to the Elasticsearch server. To resolve this issue, the following steps should be taken:

1. Check that the Elasticsearch server is running and that the correct hostname and port are being used.

2. Check that the Elasticsearch server is accessible from the client. This can be done by running a curl command, e.g. `curl http://localhost:9200`. If the server is accessible, the output should be similar to this:

```
{
  "name" : "MyServer",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "5.6.3",
    "build_hash" : "abcdefg",
    "build_date" : "2018-03-13T10:06:29.741383Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "6.6.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

3. Verify that the correct Elasticsearch version is being used. The Elastica client library needs to be compatible with the version of Elasticsearch being used.

4. Check the Elastica client settings. The `setHosts()` and `setConnections()` methods need to be correctly configured.

5. If the issue persists, try using a different version of the Elastica client library.
