# How do I use Python Keras to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR)?
// plain

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a process of recognizing text from images. Python Keras can be used to perform OCR by first pre-processing the images to make the text as clear as possible and then using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize the text in the images.

## Example code

```
import cv2
import numpy as np
from keras.models import load_model

# Pre-processing the image
image = cv2.imread('image.png')
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]

# Load the model
model = load_model('model.h5')

# Recognize the text
prediction = model.predict(thresh.reshape(1, thresh.shape[0], thresh.shape[1], 1))
prediction = np.argmax(prediction, axis=2)[0]
```

The code above first pre-processes the image by converting it to grayscale and then applying a threshold to it. Then it loads the model and uses it to recognize the text in the image.

The code consists of the following parts:
1. `import cv2` and `import numpy as np`: These are used to import the necessary libraries for the code.
2. `image = cv2.imread('image.png')`: This is used to read the image.
3. `gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`: This is used to convert the image to grayscale.
4. `thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]`: This is used to apply a threshold to the grayscale image.
5. `model = load_model('model.h5')`: This is used to load the model.
6. `prediction = model.predict(thresh.reshape(1, thresh.shape[0], thresh.shape[1], 1))`: This is used to predict the text in the image.
7. `prediction = np.argmax(prediction, axis=2)[0]`: This is used to get the prediction from the model.
