# How can I use Python and Keras to implement face recognition?
// plain

Face recognition using Python and Keras can be done using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A CNN is a type of neural network that is used for image classification and recognition. The following is an example code block that can be used to create a CNN for face recognition:

```
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This code creates a CNN with three convolutional layers, two max pooling layers, a flatten layer, and two densely connected layers. The model is then compiled with the binary crossentropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

## Code explanation


1. Conv2D: This is a 2D convolutional layer that takes an input shape (in this case, a 150x150x3 array) and applies a set of filters to it.
2. MaxPooling2D: This is a 2D max pooling layer that takes the output of the convolutional layer and reduces its dimensions.
3. Flatten: This is a flatten layer that takes the output of the max pooling layer and flattens it into a single vector.
4. Dense: This is a densely connected layer that takes the output of the flatten layer and applies a set of weights and biases to it.
5. Binary Crossentropy Loss: This is a loss function that is used to measure the difference between the predicted output and the true output.
6. Adam Optimizer: This is an optimizer that is used to minimize the loss function.
