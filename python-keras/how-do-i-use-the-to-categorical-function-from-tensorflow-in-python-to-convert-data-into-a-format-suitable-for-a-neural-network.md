# How do I use the to_categorical function from TensorFlow in Python to convert data into a format suitable for a neural network?
// plain

The `to_categorical` function from TensorFlow in Python is used to convert data into a format suitable for a neural network. It is used to convert an array of numerical values into a binary matrix, where each row corresponds to one of the possible categories.

For example, the following code snippet converts a list of labels into a binary matrix:

```
import tensorflow as tf

labels = [0, 1, 2, 3]

binary_matrix = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(labels)

print(binary_matrix)
```

## Output example

```
[[1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1.]]
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Importing the `tensorflow` library as `tf`.
2. Creating a list of labels.
3. Using the `to_categorical` function to convert the labels into a binary matrix.
4. Printing the binary matrix.

The `to_categorical` function is useful for creating training data for a neural network. It is a convenient way to convert numerical values into a binary matrix, which can be used by the neural network to classify data.
