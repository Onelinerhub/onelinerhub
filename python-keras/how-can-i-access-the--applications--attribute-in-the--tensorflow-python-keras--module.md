# How can I access the 'applications' attribute in the 'tensorflow.python.keras' module?
// plain

To access the 'applications' attribute in the 'tensorflow.python.keras' module, you can use the following code:

```
import tensorflow.python.keras as keras
applications = keras.applications
```

The code above imports the module and assigns the `applications` attribute to a variable.

The `applications` attribute is a submodule of the `tensorflow.python.keras` module that contains pre-trained models for use with TensorFlow. It includes models for image classification, object detection, text classification, and more.

The following code shows how to use the `applications` attribute to load a pre-trained model for image classification:

```
import tensorflow.python.keras as keras
applications = keras.applications
model = applications.MobileNetV2()
```

The output of the code above is a pre-trained model for image classification.

## Code explanation


- `import tensorflow.python.keras as keras`: imports the module and assigns it to a variable
- `applications = keras.applications`: assigns the `applications` attribute to a variable
- `applications.MobileNetV2()`: loads a pre-trained model for image classification
