# How do I use Python and Keras to create a tutorial?
// plain

1. To create a tutorial with Python and Keras, you will need to install the packages first. You can do this using the `pip install` command in the terminal.
2. After the packages are installed, you will need to import the necessary modules. This can be done with the following code:
```
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
```
3. Next, you will need to define the model. This can be done with the following code:
```
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
```
4. Once the model is defined, you can compile it with the following code:
```
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='sgd',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
5. After the model is compiled, you can train it with the following code:
```
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
```
6. Finally, you can evaluate the model with the following code:
```
loss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)
```
7. Once the model is evaluated, you can use it to make predictions. This can be done with the following code:
```
classes = model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128)
```
