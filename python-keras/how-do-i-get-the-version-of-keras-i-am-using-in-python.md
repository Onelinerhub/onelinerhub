# How do I get the version of Keras I am using in Python?
// plain

To get the version of Keras you are using in Python, you can use the `__version__` attribute of the `keras` module.

Here is an example of how to do this:

```python
import keras

print(keras.__version__)
```

This will print the version of Keras you are using. For example, the output may look like this:

```
2.3.1
```

The code consists of several parts:

- `import keras`: This imports the `keras` module into the current Python environment.
- `print(keras.__version__)`: This prints the version of Keras you are using, which is stored in the `__version__` attribute of the `keras` module.

For more information, please refer to the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/).
