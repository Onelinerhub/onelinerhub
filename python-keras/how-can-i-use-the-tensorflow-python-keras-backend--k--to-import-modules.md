# How can I use the TensorFlow Python Keras Backend (K) to import modules?
// plain

The TensorFlow Python Keras Backend (K) is a library that allows users to easily import modules for their TensorFlow models. To use the K backend, you must first install the library:

```
pip install tensorflow-python-keras-backend
```

Once installed, you can import modules into your TensorFlow model with the following code:

```
import tensorflow_python_keras_backend as K
```

You can then use the K backend to access the modules you need. For example, to import the Conv2D module, you would use the following code:

```
from K.layers import Conv2D
```

This code will import the Conv2D module into your model. You can also use the K backend to access other modules, such as Activation, Dense, and MaxPooling2D.

## Code explanation

- `pip install tensorflow-python-keras-backend`: This code installs the TensorFlow Python Keras Backend library.
- `import tensorflow_python_keras_backend as K`: This code imports the K backend library.
- `from K.layers import Conv2D`: This code imports the Conv2D module into your model.
