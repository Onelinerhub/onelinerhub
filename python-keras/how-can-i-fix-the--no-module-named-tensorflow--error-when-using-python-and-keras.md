# How can I fix the "no module named tensorflow" error when using Python and Keras?
// plain

The "No module named tensorflow" error is usually caused by an incorrect installation of TensorFlow. To fix it, you should first check if TensorFlow is installed correctly. You can do this by running the following code in your Python interpreter:

```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

If the code executes without any errors, it means that TensorFlow is installed correctly. If you get an error, you should try reinstalling TensorFlow using the following command:

```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

After reinstalling TensorFlow, you should be able to use it with Keras. To test it, you can run the following code:

```
import keras
from keras import backend as K
K.tensorflow_backend._get_available_gpus()
```

If the code executes without any errors, it means that Keras is successfully using TensorFlow.

- **import tensorflow as tf**: imports the TensorFlow library into the Python interpreter.
- **print(tf.__version__)**: prints the version of TensorFlow installed.
- **pip install --upgrade tensorflow**: updates or installs TensorFlow.
- **import keras**: imports the Keras library into the Python interpreter.
- **from keras import backend as K**: imports the Keras backend library.
- **K.tensorflow_backend._get_available_gpus()**: checks if Keras is using TensorFlow correctly.
