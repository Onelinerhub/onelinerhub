# How do I use Python Keras to fit a model?
// plain

Using Python Keras to fit a model involves the following steps:
1. Load the data into the model. This can be done by either loading the data from a file or by creating the data from scratch.
2. Preprocess the data. This includes normalizing, scaling, and/or transforming the data to make it more suitable for the model.
3. Create the model. This involves defining the architecture of the model, such as the number of layers, the number of neurons, and the activation functions.
4. Compile the model. This involves specifying the optimizer, the loss function, and the metrics.
5. Fit the model. This involves feeding the data into the model and training it.

Example code block:
```
# Load data
data = load_data()

# Preprocess data
data = preprocess_data(data)

# Create model
model = create_model()

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit model
model.fit(data, epochs=10)
```

Output of example code:
```
Epoch 1/10
...
Epoch 10/10
...
```

## Code explanation

- `load_data()`: This function loads the data into the model.
- `preprocess_data(data)`: This function preprocesses the data by normalizing, scaling, and/or transforming it.
- `create_model()`: This function creates the model by defining the architecture of the model, such as the number of layers, the number of neurons, and the activation functions.
- `model.compile()`: This function compiles the model by specifying the optimizer, the loss function, and the metrics.
- `model.fit()`: This function fits the model by feeding the data into the model and training it.
