# How can I use Python and Keras to create a neural network?
// plain

Using Python and Keras to create a neural network is relatively straightforward. First, you must import the necessary packages:

```
import numpy as np
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
```

Then, you must define the model. This can be done with the following code:

```
# define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
```

Once the model is defined, you must compile it. This is done with the following code:

```
# compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Finally, you must fit the model to the data. This is done with the following code:

```
# fit the model
model.fit(X, Y, epochs=150, batch_size=10)
```

The above code will create a neural network using Python and Keras.

## Code explanation

- `import numpy as np`: imports the Numpy package, which is used for numerical computing.
- `import keras`: imports the Keras package, which is used for deep learning.
- `from keras.models import Sequential`: imports the Sequential model from Keras, which is used to define a sequence of layers in the neural network.
- `from keras.layers import Dense`: imports the Dense layer from Keras, which is used to define a fully connected layer in the neural network.
- `model = Sequential()`: creates a new Sequential model.
- `model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))`: adds a Dense layer to the model, with 12 neurons, 8 input dimensions, and the ReLU activation function.
- `model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))`: adds another Dense layer to the model, with 8 neurons and the ReLU activation function.
- `model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))`: adds a third Dense layer to the model, with 1 neuron and the sigmoid activation function.
- `model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])`: compiles the model, using the binary cross-entropy loss function, the Adam optimizer, and the accuracy metric.
- `model.fit(X, Y, epochs=150, batch_size=10)`: fits the model to the data, using 150 epochs and a batch size of 10.
