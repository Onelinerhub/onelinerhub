# How can I set objectives for my Python Keras project?
// plain

Setting objectives for a Python Keras project can be done in several ways.

1. Define the project goal and objectives: A clear goal and objectives should be established to ensure that the project is on track and that it meets expectations.

2. Establish a timeline: A timeline should be established to ensure that the project is completed in a timely manner.

3. Develop a plan of action: A plan of action should be developed to ensure that the project is completed efficiently and effectively.

4. Define the scope of the project: The scope of the project should be defined to ensure that all tasks are completed within the timeframe and budget.

5. Identify resources: Resources should be identified to ensure that all tasks are completed within the timeframe and budget.

6. Create a test plan: A test plan should be created to ensure that the project is tested and validated before being released.

7. Monitor progress: Progress should be monitored to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.

## Example code

```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# fit the model
model.fit(X, Y, epochs=150, batch_size=10)
```

## Output example

```
Epoch 1/150
45/45 [==============================] - 0s 1ms/step - loss: 0.7128 - accuracy: 0.4622
Epoch 2/150
45/45 [==============================] - 0s 990us/step - loss: 0.6997 - accuracy: 0.5111
...
Epoch 149/150
45/45 [==============================] - 0s 945us/step - loss: 0.0044 - accuracy: 1.0000
Epoch 150/150
45/45 [==============================] - 0s 945us/step - loss: 0.0043 - accuracy: 1.0000
```

## Code explanation

- `from keras.models import Sequential` imports the Sequential model from the Keras library.
- `from keras.layers import Dense` imports the Dense layer from the Keras library.
- `model = Sequential()` creates a Sequential model object.
- `model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))` adds a Dense layer with 12 neurons and an input dimension of 8 to the model. The activation function used is ReLU.
- `model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))` adds a Dense layer with 8 neurons and an input dimension of 8 to the model. The activation function used is ReLU.
- `model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))` adds a Dense layer with 1 neuron and an input dimension of 8 to the model. The activation function used is Sigmoid.
- `model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])` compiles the model. The loss function used is binary cross-entropy and the optimizer used is Adam. The metric used is accuracy.
- `model.fit(X, Y, epochs=150, batch_size=10)` fits the model on the training data. The number of epochs is set to 150 and the batch size is set to 10.
