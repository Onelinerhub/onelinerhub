# How can I split my data into train and test sets using Python and Keras?
// plain

Using Python and Keras, you can split your data into train and test sets by using the `train_test_split` function from the `scikit-learn` library. This function takes in the data and splits it into two sets, a training set and a testing set. The code below shows an example of how to use the `train_test_split` function:

```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
```

This code will randomly split the data into two sets, with 80% of the data in the training set and 20% in the testing set. The `X` and `y` variables represent the data and labels respectively. The `test_size` parameter specifies the proportion of the data that should be in the testing set. The `random_state` parameter is used to control the randomness of the split.

## Code explanation


- `X_train`: This is the training set of data.
- `X_test`: This is the testing set of data.
- `y_train`: This is the training set of labels.
- `y_test`: This is the testing set of labels.
- `test_size`: This is the proportion of the data that should be in the testing set.
- `random_state`: This is used to control the randomness of the split.

For more information about the `train_test_split` function, see the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html).
