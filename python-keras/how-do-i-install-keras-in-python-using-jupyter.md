# How do I install Keras in Python using Jupyter?
// plain

1. First, you need to install the Python packages for Keras. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:
```pip install keras```

2. Next, you need to install the Jupyter notebook. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:
```pip install jupyter```

3. After the installation is complete, you can open up a Jupyter notebook and start coding.

4. To test if Keras is installed correctly, you can run the following code in your Jupyter notebook:
```import keras
keras.__version__```

## Output example
 `2.4.3`

5. This code imports the Keras library and prints out the version of Keras that is installed.

6. Once you have verified that Keras is installed correctly, you can start using it in your Jupyter notebook.

7. For more information about how to use Keras in Jupyter, please refer to the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/).
