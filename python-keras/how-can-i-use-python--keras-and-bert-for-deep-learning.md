# How can I use Python, Keras and BERT for deep learning?
// plain

Python, Keras, and BERT are all powerful tools for deep learning. Here is an example of how to use them together:

```
# import libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras_bert import load_trained_model_from_checkpoint

# load BERT model
bert_model_path = 'model/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12'
bert_model = load_trained_model_from_checkpoint(bert_model_path)

# create Keras model
model = keras.Sequential([
    bert_model,
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# train model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=5)
```

This example code creates a Keras model with a BERT layer, compiles it, and then trains it with the given data.

The code consists of the following parts:
1. Importing libraries: `import tensorflow as tf` and `from tensorflow import keras` are used to import the necessary libraries. `from keras_bert import load_trained_model_from_checkpoint` is used to import the BERT model.
2. Loading BERT model: `bert_model_path` is set to the path of the BERT model, and then `load_trained_model_from_checkpoint` is used to load the model.
3. Creating Keras model: A Keras Sequential model is created with a BERT layer and a Dense layer with a sigmoid activation.
4. Compiling model: The model is compiled with the `adam` optimizer and `binary_crossentropy` loss.
5. Training model: The model is trained with the given data.
