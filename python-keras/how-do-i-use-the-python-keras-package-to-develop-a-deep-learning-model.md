# How do I use the Python Keras package to develop a deep learning model?
// plain

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. It allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).

To use the Python Keras package to develop a deep learning model, you should first install the package. You can do this using pip:

```
pip install keras
```

Once the package is installed, you can begin developing your deep learning model. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Prepare your data for the model. This includes loading, cleaning, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

2. **Model Definition:** Define the layers, nodes, activation functions, and optimizers for the model.

3. **Model Compilation:** Compile the model using a loss function and an optimizer.

4. **Model Fitting:** Fit the model to the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model on the test data.

Here is an example of code that can be used to develop a deep learning model using Keras:

```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, input_dim=10, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# fit the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# evaluate the model
scores = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print("\n%s: %.2f%%" % (model.metrics_names[1], scores[1]*100))
```

## Output example

```
accuracy: 98.00%
```
