# How can I use batch normalization in TensorFlow with Python and Keras?
// plain

Batch normalization is a technique used to reduce internal covariate shift and improve the training of deep neural networks. In TensorFlow with Python and Keras, it can be implemented as follows:

```
from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization

model = Sequential()
model.add(BatchNormalization())
```

This code adds a batch normalization layer to a sequential model. The layer will normalize the input data by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation.

## Code explanation


* `from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization`: imports the BatchNormalization class from the tensorflow.keras.layers module
* `model = Sequential()`: creates a Sequential model
* `model.add(BatchNormalization())`: adds a BatchNormalization layer to the model
