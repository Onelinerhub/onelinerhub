How do I use Python and Keras to perform image classification?

Image classification is the process of assigning a label to an image based on its content. It can be done with Python and Keras, a high-level neural networks API.

The following example code shows how to use the Keras library to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.

```python
# import necessary libraries
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, Flatten

# create model
model = Sequential()

# add model layers
model.add(Conv2D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)))
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# compile model using accuracy to measure model performance
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=3)
```

This example code creates a CNN model with two convolutional layers and one dense layer. The convolutional layers extract features from the input images and the dense layer is used for classification. The model is then compiled using accuracy as the metric and trained on the training data.

The parts of this code are:

1. `from keras.models import Sequential`: imports the Sequential model from the Keras library.
2. `model = Sequential()`: creates a Sequential model object.
3. `model.add(Conv2D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)))`: adds a convolutional layer with 64 filters, a kernel size of 3, a ReLU activation function, and an input shape of 28x28x1.
4. `model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'))`: adds a convolutional layer with 32 filters, a kernel size of 3, and a ReLU activation function.
5. `model.add(Flatten())`: flattens the output from the convolutional layers.
6. `model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))`: adds a dense layer with 10 neurons and a softmax activation function.
7. `model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])`: compiles the model using the Adam optimizer, a categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the metric.
8. `model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=3)`: trains the model on the training data with the validation data and 3 epochs.
