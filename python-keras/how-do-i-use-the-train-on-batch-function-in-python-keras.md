# How do I use the train_on_batch function in Python Keras?
// plain

The `train_on_batch` function is a Keras function used to train a model on a single batch of data. It is used when training a model in batches, rather than training on the entire dataset at once.

## Example code

```
model.train_on_batch(x_batch, y_batch)
```

This code will train the model on a single batch of data, where `x_batch` is the input data and `y_batch` is the desired output.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `model`: The model object that will be trained.
2. `train_on_batch`: The function that will be used to train the model.
3. `x_batch`: The input data that will be used to train the model.
4. `y_batch`: The desired output that will be used to train the model.

More information about the `train_on_batch` function can be found in the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#train_on_batch-method).
