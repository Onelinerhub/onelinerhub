# How can I use the applications attribute in TensorFlow Python Keras?
// plain

The `applications` attribute in TensorFlow Python Keras can be used to quickly and easily create deep learning models. It contains several pre-trained models that are ready to be used in your own applications.

For example, you can use the `applications` attribute to quickly and easily create a convolutional neural network model:

```
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

model = VGG16()
```

This code will create a VGG16 convolutional neural network model that is ready to be used.

The `applications` attribute contains a list of several pre-trained models, including:

* VGG16
* VGG19
* ResNet50
* InceptionV3
* Xception
* MobileNet

Each of these models can be used to quickly and easily create a deep learning model.

The code to create a model using the `applications` attribute is the same for each model. For example, the code to create a ResNet50 model is:

```
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50

model = ResNet50()
```

The output of this code is a ResNet50 model that is ready to be used.
