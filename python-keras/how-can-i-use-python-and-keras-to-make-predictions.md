# How can I use Python and Keras to make predictions?
// plain

Using Python and Keras, you can make predictions by building and training a neural network model. A neural network model is composed of layers, each of which contains a set of neurons that are connected to each other. The neurons in each layer are connected to the neurons in the next layer, and the output of the model is the result of the neurons in the final layer.

To make predictions using Python and Keras, you need to first create a model, then compile the model, and finally fit the model to the data.

## Example code


```
# import the necessary packages
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# create the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=2, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))

# compile the model
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

# fit the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=1000, verbose=0)

# make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
```

The code above creates a simple neural network with two layers and 10 neurons in the first layer, and 1 neuron in the output layer. The model is then compiled, and fit to the data (X and y). Finally, predictions are made using the model.

## Code explanation

- `from keras.models import Sequential`: imports the Sequential model from the Keras library
- `model = Sequential()`: creates a Sequential model
- `model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=2, activation='relu'))`: adds a Dense layer to the model with 10 neurons, input dimension of 2, and ReLU activation
- `model.add(Dense(1))`: adds a Dense layer to the model with 1 neuron
- `model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')`: compiles the model with mean squared error loss and Adam optimizer
- `model.fit(X, y, epochs=1000, verbose=0)`: fits the model to the data (X and y) for 1000 epochs
- `predictions = model.predict(X)`: makes predictions using the model on the data X
