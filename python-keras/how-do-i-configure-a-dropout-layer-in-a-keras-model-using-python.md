# How do I configure a dropout layer in a Keras model using Python?
// plain

A Dropout layer is a type of regularization technique used to reduce overfitting in neural networks. In Keras, a Dropout layer can be configured using the `Dropout` layer class. The following example code configures a Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2:

```
from keras.layers import Dropout

model.add(Dropout(0.2))
```

The dropout rate is a float value between 0 and 1, which represents the fraction of the input units to drop. In this example, 0.2 represents 20% of the input units.

The list below explains the parts of the code:

- `from keras.layers import Dropout`: Imports the Dropout layer class from Keras.
- `model.add(Dropout(0.2))`: Adds a Dropout layer to the model, with a dropout rate of 0.2.

For more information, please refer to the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout).
