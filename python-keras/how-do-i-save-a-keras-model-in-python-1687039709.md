# How do I save a Keras model in Python?
// plain

Saving a Keras model in Python is relatively simple and can be done in a few lines of code. To save a model, we use the `model.save()` function. This function takes in a file path to save the model to. For example:

```
model.save('model.h5')
```

This will save the model as an HDF5 file called `model.h5`.

The `model.save()` function has several optional parameters that can be used to customize the saving process. For example, the `include_optimizer` parameter can be set to `True` to save the state of the optimizer used to train the model, allowing the model to resume training where it left off.

The following is a list of the parts of the code and a brief explanation of each:

* `model.save()`: This is the function used to save the model.
* `model.h5`: This is the file path to save the model to.
* `include_optimizer`: This is an optional parameter that can be set to `True` to save the state of the optimizer used to train the model.
