# How do I use the pad_sequences function in Python Keras?
// plain

The pad_sequences function in Python Keras is used to ensure that all sequences in a list have the same length. This is important for neural networks, as inputs must be consistently sized in order to be processed.

For example, to pad a sequence of length 4 to a maximum length of 6, the code would be:
```
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

input_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4]
padded_sequence = pad_sequences([input_sequence], maxlen=6, padding='post')

print(padded_sequence)
```
The output of this code would be `[[1 2 3 4 0 0]]`.

The code is composed of the following parts:
- `from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences`: imports the pad_sequences function from the Keras library.
- `input_sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4]`: defines the input sequence.
- `pad_sequences([input_sequence], maxlen=6, padding='post')`: uses the pad_sequences function to pad the input sequence to a maximum length of 6, with padding added to the end of the sequence (post).
- `print(padded_sequence)`: prints the padded sequence.
