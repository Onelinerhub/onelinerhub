// plain

Installing Keras on Windows using Python is a relatively straightforward process. The following steps should be followed:

1. Install the Python interpreter and associated packages. This can be done using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution, which includes Python and the most popular packages.

2. Install the TensorFlow library. This can be done using the `pip` command:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

3. Install the Keras library. This can be done using the `pip` command:
```
pip install keras
```

4. Verify the installation. This can be done by running the following code in Python:
```
import keras
print(keras.__version__)
```
The output should be something like `2.3.1`.

5. Optional: Install additional packages for visualization and deep learning. This can be done using the `pip` command:
```
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install scipy
```

These steps should ensure that Keras is successfully installed on Windows using Python.
