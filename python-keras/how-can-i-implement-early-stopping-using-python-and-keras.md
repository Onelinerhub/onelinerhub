# How can I implement early stopping using Python and Keras?
// plain

Early stopping is a popular technique used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. It can be implemented using Python and Keras by using the `EarlyStopping` callback. This callback monitors the model's performance, and when a chosen metric (e.g. validation loss) no longer improves, the training process is stopped.

## Example code

```
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, callbacks=[es], epochs=100)
```

The code above uses the `EarlyStopping` callback to monitor the validation loss of the model. The `patience` argument specifies how many epochs to wait before stopping training when the validation loss has not improved.

## Code explanation

- `EarlyStopping`: callback used to monitor the model's performance and stop training when a chosen metric no longer improves
- `monitor`: the metric to monitor (e.g. validation loss)
- `patience`: the number of epochs to wait before stopping training when the validation loss has not improved
