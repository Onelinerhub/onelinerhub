# How do I check which version of Keras I am using in Python?
// plain

To check which version of Keras you are using in Python, you can use the following code block:

```
import keras
print(keras.__version__)
```

The output of this code will be the version of Keras you are using. For example, if you are using version 2.2.4, the output will be `2.2.4`.

The code block above consists of two parts:

1. `import keras`: This imports the Keras library into your Python environment.
2. `print(keras.__version__)`: This prints out the version of Keras you are using.

If you need more information about Keras, you can find it on the [Keras website](https://keras.io/).
