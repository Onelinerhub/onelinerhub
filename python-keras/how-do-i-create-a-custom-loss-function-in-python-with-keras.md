# How do I create a custom loss function in Python with Keras?
// plain

Creating a custom loss function in Python with Keras is fairly straightforward.

Below is an example of a custom loss function written in Python with Keras:
```
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(K.square(y_true - y_pred))
```

This custom loss function calculates the mean of the squared difference between the true values and the predicted values.

## Code explanation


- `def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):` This defines the custom loss function as `custom_loss` and takes two arguments, `y_true` and `y_pred`, which represent the true and predicted values respectively.

- `return K.mean(K.square(y_true - y_pred))` This is the body of the custom loss function and returns the mean of the squared difference between the true and predicted values.
