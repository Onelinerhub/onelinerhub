# How do I calculate the loss for a model using Python and Keras?
// plain

The loss of a model in Python and Keras can be calculated using the `model.evaluate()` function. The `model.evaluate()` function takes in two arguments: the test data and the test labels. It then returns the loss value for the model.

## Example code

```
loss = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(loss)
```

## Output example

```
0.065
```

The `model.evaluate()` function works by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted values and the true values. The MSE is then used to calculate the loss.

Parts of the code:

* `model.evaluate()` – This is the function used to calculate the loss of the model.
* `x_test` – This is the test data.
* `y_test` – This is the test labels.
* `loss` – This is the variable that stores the loss value.
* `print(loss)` – This is used to print the loss value.
