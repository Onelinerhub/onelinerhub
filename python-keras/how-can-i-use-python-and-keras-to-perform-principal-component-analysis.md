# How can I use Python and Keras to perform Principal Component Analysis?
// plain

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much of the original information as possible. It can be used to reduce the number of features in a dataset, or to identify patterns in a dataset.

Python and Keras can be used to perform PCA. To do this, we first need to import the necessary libraries, such as numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn:

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
```

Next, we need to create our dataset. For this example, we will create a 2D array of random numbers:

```
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)
```

We can then create a PCA object and fit it to our dataset:

```
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(X)
```

Finally, we can transform our dataset using the PCA object:

```
X_pca = pca.transform(X)
```

The output of this code is a 2D array containing the transformed dataset. We can then use the transformed dataset for further analysis, such as clustering or visualization.

## Code explanation

1. Importing necessary libraries:
   - `import numpy as np`: This imports the NumPy library, which is used for numerical computing.
   - `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: This imports the Matplotlib library, which is used for plotting and visualizing data.
   - `from sklearn.decomposition import PCA`: This imports the scikit-learn library, which is used for machine learning algorithms. The PCA class is used for performing Principal Component Analysis.
2. Creating the dataset:
   - `X = np.random.rand(100, 2)`: This creates a 2D array of random numbers.
3. Creating the PCA object and fitting it to the dataset:
   - `pca = PCA(n_components=2)`: This creates a PCA object with n_components set to 2, which means that the PCA will be performed on two dimensions.
   - `pca.fit(X)`: This fits the PCA object to the dataset.
4. Transforming the dataset using the PCA object:
   - `X_pca = pca.transform(X)`: This transforms the dataset using the PCA object. The output of this code is a 2D array containing the transformed dataset.
