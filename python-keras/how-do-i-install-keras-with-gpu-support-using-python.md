# How do I install Keras with GPU support using Python?
// plain

1. First, you need to install the prerequisites for Keras. This includes the Python packages Tensorflow, Theano, and Numpy.

2. Next, you need to install the GPU version of Tensorflow. This can be done using the command ```pip install tensorflow-gpu```.

3. After Tensorflow is installed, you can install Keras with GPU support by using the command ```pip install keras-gpu```.

4. Once Keras is installed, you can check that GPU support is enabled by running the following code:

```
from keras import backend as K

if K.tensorflow_backend._get_available_gpus():
    print("GPU is available")
else:
    print("GPU is not available")
```

## Output example

```
GPU is available
```

5. Finally, you can use the GPU for training your Keras models by setting the following environment variable:

```
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

6. This will ensure that any Keras models you train will use the GPU for processing.

7. For more information, please refer to the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-run-keras-on-gpu).
