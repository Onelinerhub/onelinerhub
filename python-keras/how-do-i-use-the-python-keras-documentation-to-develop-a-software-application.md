# How do I use the Python Keras documentation to develop a software application?

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. The Keras documentation provides comprehensive information about the library and its use.

To use the Python Keras documentation to develop a software application, you can start by exploring the tutorials and examples provided in the documentation. These will help you get familiar with the library and its features.

For example, the following code block shows a simple example of a convolutional neural network (CNN) created using Keras:

```python
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
from keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizers.RMSprop(lr=1e-4),
              metrics=['acc'])
```

This code creates a convolutional neural network with five convolutional layers, a flatten layer, and two dense layers.

The Keras documentation also provides information on the various layers, optimizers, losses, metrics, and other features that can be used to customize the model. For more information, you can refer to the [Keras API reference](https://keras.io/api/).

In addition, the Keras documentation also includes information on how to train, evaluate, and save models, as well as how to deploy models to production. This information can be found in the [Getting Started guide](https://keras.io/getting-started/).

Finally, the Keras website also provides a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) with the source code for the library. This can be used to get an in-depth understanding of how the library works.
