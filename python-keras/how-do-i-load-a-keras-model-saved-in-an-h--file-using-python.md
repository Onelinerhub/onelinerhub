# How do I load a Keras model saved in an H5 file using Python?
// plain

Loading a Keras model saved in an H5 file using Python is a simple process. First, the necessary libraries need to be imported. This includes the TensorFlow library, the Keras library, and the h5py library.

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import h5py
```

Then, the model can be loaded using the `load_model` function from the Keras library, passing in the H5 file as an argument.

```
model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
```

The model can then be used to make predictions, evaluate the model, or make other modifications as needed.

```
predictions = model.predict(x_test)
```

Parts of the code:

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: imports the TensorFlow library.
2. `from tensorflow import keras`: imports the Keras library from TensorFlow.
3. `import h5py`: imports the h5py library.
4. `model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')`: loads the model from the H5 file.
5. `predictions = model.predict(x_test)`: makes predictions using the loaded model.
