# How do I evaluate a model in Python using Keras?
// plain

Evaluating a model in Python using Keras is relatively straightforward. The following example code block demonstrates how to evaluate a model using the `model.evaluate()` function:

```
# evaluate the model
scores = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print("\n%s: %.2f%%" % (model.metrics_names[1], scores[1]*100))
```

This code will output the accuracy score of the model on the test set:

```
acc: 98.00%
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `model.evaluate()`: This is a Keras function that evaluates the model on a given dataset. It takes two arguments: the test data (`X_test`) and the test labels (`y_test`).

2. `model.metrics_names[1]`: This is a list of the metrics that the model is evaluated on, with the first element being the name of the metric (in this case, `acc` for accuracy).

3. `scores[1]`: This is the score of the model on the given metric (in this case, accuracy).

4. `print()`: This prints the metric name and score to the console.

More information on evaluating models in Keras can be found in the [Keras Documentation](https://keras.io/models/model/#evaluate).
