# How do I import Keras into Python?
// plain

To import Keras into Python, you can use the following code:
```
import keras
```
This will import the Keras library and allow you to use its various classes and functions.

The code above can be broken down into the following parts:
- `import`: This is a keyword used to import a library into the current program.
- `keras`: This is the name of the library that we are importing.

In addition, you can also use the `from` keyword to import specific classes and functions from the library. For example, if you want to import the `Conv2D` class from the `layers` module, you could use the following code:

```
from keras.layers import Conv2D
```

The code above can be broken down into the following parts:
- `from`: This is a keyword used to import specific classes or functions from a library.
- `keras.layers`: This is the name of the module that contains the `Conv2D` class.
- `import`: This is a keyword used to import the specified class or function from the module.
- `Conv2D`: This is the name of the class that we are importing.

For more information on importing libraries in Python, please refer to the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html).
