# How can I use Python to create a model in Keras?
// plain

Using Python and Keras, you can create a model to solve a given problem. The following example code demonstrates how to create a simple model using the Sequential API of Keras:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create a sequential model
model = keras.Sequential()

# Add layers to the model
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

The code above will create a simple model with three layers, two of which are dense layers with 32 and 16 neurons respectively, and an output layer with a single neuron and a sigmoid activation function. The model is then compiled with the Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss function, and accuracy as the metric.

The following list explains the various parts of the code in detail:
1. **Importing TensorFlow and Keras**: This imports the necessary libraries for creating a model.
2. **Creating a Sequential model**: This creates an empty model object that can be used to add layers.
3. **Adding layers**: This adds layers to the model. In this case, two dense layers with 32 and 16 neurons respectively, and an output layer with a single neuron and a sigmoid activation function.
4. **Compiling the model**: This compiles the model with the Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss function, and accuracy as the metric.
