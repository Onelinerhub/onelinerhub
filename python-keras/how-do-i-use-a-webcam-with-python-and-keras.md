# How do I use a webcam with Python and Keras?
// plain

Using a webcam with Python and Keras is quite simple. First, we need to import the necessary packages, such as the OpenCV library, Keras, and Numpy.

```
import cv2
import keras
import numpy as np
```

Next, we need to capture the video from the webcam. We can do this with the cv2.VideoCapture() function. We can also set the resolution of the video with the set() function.

```
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
cap.set(3,640)
cap.set(4,480)
```

After that, we can read the frames from the video stream. We can do this with the read() function.

```
ret, frame = cap.read()
```

Now, we can pre-process the frame for use with Keras. We can do this by resizing the frame and converting it to a Numpy array.

```
frame = cv2.resize(frame, (224, 224))
frame = np.array(frame, dtype=np.float32)
```

Finally, we can use the frame with Keras. We can do this by passing the frame into the model.

```
prediction = model.predict(frame)
```

That's all there is to using a webcam with Python and Keras.
