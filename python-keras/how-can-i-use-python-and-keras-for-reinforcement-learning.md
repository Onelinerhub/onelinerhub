# How can I use Python and Keras for reinforcement learning?
// plain

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that allows agents to learn how to interact with their environment in order to maximize their rewards. Python and Keras can be used together for RL tasks. Keras provides a high-level interface to neural networks, allowing developers to quickly build models without having to understand the underlying algorithms.

## Example code

```
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu', input_dim=4))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This code creates a neural network with two layers, each with 32 nodes. The first layer has an input dimension of 4, and the second layer has an output dimension of 2. The model is then compiled using the Adam optimizer and the categorical cross-entropy loss function.

To use this model for RL, we need to define a reward function and train the model using reinforcement learning. This can be done using the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) library.

## Example code

```
import gym
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')

# Train model
for episode in range(500):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        action = model.predict(state)
        new_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        model.fit(state, reward, epochs=1, verbose=0)
        state = new_state
```

This code creates an environment and then trains the model using the reward given by the environment. The model is fit on each step, using the current state and the reward given by the environment.
