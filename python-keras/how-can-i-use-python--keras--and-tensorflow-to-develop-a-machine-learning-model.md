# How can I use Python, Keras, and TensorFlow to develop a machine learning model?
// plain

Using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow to develop a machine learning model is relatively straightforward. The following example code block shows how to create a simple model using these libraries:

```
# Import libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create a Sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')
```

## Code explanation


1. Import the necessary libraries: `import tensorflow as tf` and `from tensorflow import keras`.
2. Create a Sequential model using `keras.Sequential` and add the desired layers. In this example, a single `Dense` layer is used with one unit and an input shape of one.
3. Compile the model using `model.compile` and specifying the optimizer and loss function. In this example, `sgd` is used as the optimizer and `mean_squared_error` as the loss function.
