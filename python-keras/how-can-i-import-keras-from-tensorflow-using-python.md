# How can I import Keras from TensorFlow using Python?
// plain

To import Keras from TensorFlow using Python, you need to install both TensorFlow and Keras on your system, and then import the Keras module in Python.

The following example code shows how to import the Keras module from TensorFlow in Python:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
```

The code above imports the TensorFlow library as `tf` and then imports the Keras module from TensorFlow.

The parts of the code above are as follows:

1. `import tensorflow as tf`: This line imports the TensorFlow library into Python and assigns it to the variable `tf`.
2. `from tensorflow import keras`: This line imports the Keras module from TensorFlow.

No output is produced from this code.
