# How do I use the Adam optimizer with Keras and Python?
// plain

The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for training deep learning models in Keras and Python. It combines the advantages of the Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms to provide an efficient and effective optimization algorithm.

To use the Adam optimizer with Keras and Python, you need to specify the optimizer when compiling the model. The following example code shows how to compile a model using the Adam optimizer:

```
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

The code above uses the `model.compile` function to compile the model, specifying the `loss` (the type of loss function to use), the `optimizer` (in this case, `adam` for the Adam optimizer), and the `metrics` (the metrics to track during training).

The Adam optimizer has several hyperparameters that can be adjusted to improve model performance. These include the learning rate, the beta1 and beta2 parameters, and the epsilon parameter. The following example code shows how to specify the learning rate when using the Adam optimizer:

```
opt = keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.001)
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer=opt, metrics=['accuracy'])
```

The code above creates an Adam optimizer object with the learning rate set to `0.001` and then passes it to the `model.compile` function as the `optimizer` parameter.
