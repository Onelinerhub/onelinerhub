# How do I use Python Keras to create a Zoom application?
// plain

Creating a Zoom application with Python Keras requires a few steps.

1. Install the necessary packages. This includes `Keras`, `TensorFlow`, and `OpenCV`.
```
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
```

2. Import the packages into your Python script.
```
import keras
import tensorflow as tf
import cv2
```

3. Create a model using the Keras Sequential API. This is done by adding layers to the model.
```
model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'))
```

4. Compile the model. This is done by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
```
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

5. Train the model using the data. This is done by specifying the training data and the number of epochs.
```
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
```

6. Use OpenCV to capture the video feed from the Zoom application.
```
video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
```

7. Use the trained model to make predictions on the video feed.
```
prediction = model.predict(video_capture)
```
