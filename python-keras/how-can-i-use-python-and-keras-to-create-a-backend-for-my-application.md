# How can I use Python and Keras to create a backend for my application?
// plain

Using Python and Keras, you can create a backend for your application. To do this, you will need to create a model that can be used to make predictions. Here is an example of how to do this with Keras:

```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# create model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# compile model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# fit the model
model.fit(X, Y, epochs=150, batch_size=10)
```

This code creates a model with three layers, an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. The input layer has 8 neurons, the hidden layer has 12 neurons and the output layer has 1 neuron. The model is then compiled using binary crossentropy as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer. Finally, the model is fit to the data using 150 epochs and a batch size of 10.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions. The model can be saved and then loaded later when needed. The model can also be used to make predictions on new data.

## Code explanation


1. `from keras.models import Sequential` - imports the Sequential model from Keras.
2. `from keras.layers import Dense` - imports the Dense layer from Keras.
3. `model = Sequential()` - creates a Sequential model.
4. `model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))` - adds a Dense layer with 12 neurons, an input dimension of 8 and a ReLU activation function.
5. `model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))` - adds a Dense layer with 8 neurons and a ReLU activation function.
6. `model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))` - adds a Dense layer with 1 neuron and a sigmoid activation function.
7. `model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])` - compiles the model with binary crossentropy as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer.
8. `model.fit(X, Y, epochs=150, batch_size=10)` - fits the model to the data using 150 epochs and a batch size of 10.
