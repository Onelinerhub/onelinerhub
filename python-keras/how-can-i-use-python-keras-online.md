# How can I use Python Keras online?
// plain

Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python. It can be used to quickly and easily build, train, and evaluate deep learning models. You can use Keras online through a number of different services.

One popular service is Google Colab, which is a free cloud-based service for running Jupyter notebooks. To use Keras on Google Colab, you can install it using the following code:

```
!pip install -q keras
```

Once Keras is installed, you can import it into your notebook and start building models:

```
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential()
```

You can also use Keras with other cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and FloydHub. These services provide virtual machines with pre-installed versions of Keras, as well as other deep learning frameworks.

Finally, there are several online services that provide a web-based interface for building and training deep learning models with Keras. Some of these services include Deep Cognition, FloydHub, and Paperspace.

- `!pip install -q keras`: Installs the Keras library in the current environment.
- `import keras`: Imports the Keras library into the current Python script.
- `from keras.models import Sequential`: Imports the Sequential model from the Keras library.
- `model = Sequential()`: Creates a new Sequential model.
