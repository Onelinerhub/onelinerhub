A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network that is used to process sequences of data. The RNN can be implemented in Python using the Keras library, which is a high-level API for building and training neural networks.

Below is an example of how to create and train an RNN using Keras:

```
# Import the necessary libraries
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import SimpleRNN

# Create the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(SimpleRNN(units=4, input_shape=(2,3)))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='sgd', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

The code above creates a simple RNN with 4 units and an input shape of (2,3). The model is then compiled with a mean-squared-error loss function and the SGD optimizer. Finally, the model is trained using the x_train and y_train datasets for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.

The parts of the code are as follows:

- `from keras.models import Sequential`: Imports the Sequential model from the Keras library.
- `from keras.layers import SimpleRNN`: Imports the SimpleRNN layer from the Keras library.
- `model = Sequential()`: Creates a new Sequential model.
- `model.add(SimpleRNN(units=4, input_shape=(2,3)))`: Adds a SimpleRNN layer with 4 units and an input shape of (2,3) to the model.
- `model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='sgd', metrics=['accuracy'])`: Compiles the model with a mean-squared-error loss function and the SGD optimizer.
- `model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)`: Trains the model using the x_train and y_train datasets for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.
