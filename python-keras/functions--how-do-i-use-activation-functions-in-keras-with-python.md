How do I use activation functions in Keras with Python?
// plain

A function in Keras with Python is a layer that takes in a set of weighted inputs and produces an output through an activation function. An activation function is a mathematical equation that determines the output of a neural network. In Keras, there are several built-in activation functions, such as sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and softmax.

The following example code shows how to use the sigmoid activation function in Keras with Python:

```
from keras.layers import Activation

model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
```

This code adds a sigmoid activation layer to the model. The output of this layer will be a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the input being classified as a positive class.

The following is a list of the various activation functions available in Keras with Python and a brief explanation of each one:

- Sigmoid: This activation function produces a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the input being classified as a positive class.
- Tanh: This activation function produces values between -1 and 1.
- ReLU: This activation function produces a value of 0 if the input is negative and the input value if the input is positive.
- Softmax: This activation function produces a probability distribution over the output classes, with the highest probability being the predicted class.
