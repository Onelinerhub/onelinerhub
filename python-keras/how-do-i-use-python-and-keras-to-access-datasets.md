# How do I use Python and Keras to access datasets?
// plain

Using Python and Keras to access datasets is a simple process. The following example code will illustrate how to do this:

```
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import mnist

# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```
This code will load the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digits, into the variables `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, and `y_test`.

The code consists of the following parts:
1. `import numpy as np` imports the NumPy library, which is used for scientific computing in Python.
2. `from keras.datasets import mnist` imports the mnist dataset from the Keras library.
3. `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()` loads the MNIST dataset into the variables `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, and `y_test`.
