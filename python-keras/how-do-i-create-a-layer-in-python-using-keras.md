# How do I create a layer in Python using Keras?
// plain

Using Keras, creating a layer in Python is a straightforward process. To create a layer, use the `keras.layers.Layer` class. Here is an example of creating a simple layer:

```
import keras

class MyLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, output_dim, **kwargs):
        self.output_dim = output_dim
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        # Create a trainable weight variable for this layer.
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(name='kernel',
                                      shape=(input_shape[1], self.output_dim),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      trainable=True)
        super(MyLayer, self).build(input_shape)  # Be sure to call this at the end

```

The `__init__` method is used to define the parameters of the layer. The `build` method is used to create the layer's weights. In this example, a single weight is created with an initializer set to 'uniform'.

The following are the parts of the code that should be noted:

1. `keras.layers.Layer`: This is the class used to create the layer.
2. `__init__`: This is the method used to define the parameters of the layer.
3. `build`: This is the method used to create the layer's weights.
4. `add_weight`: This is the method used to create the layer's weights.
5. `initializer`: This is the argument used to specify the initializer for the layer's weights.
