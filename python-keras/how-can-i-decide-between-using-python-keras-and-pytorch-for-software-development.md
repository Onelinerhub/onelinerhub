# How can I decide between using Python Keras and PyTorch for software development?
// plain

When deciding between using Python Keras and PyTorch for software development, there are several factors to consider.

1. **Ease of use**: Keras has a simpler, more intuitive syntax and is easier to learn for beginners. PyTorch, on the other hand, requires more knowledge of the underlying framework and is more difficult to learn.

2. **Performance**: PyTorch is often faster than Keras due to its low-level nature and flexibility, but this comes at the cost of having to write more code.

3. **Popularity**: Keras is more popular than PyTorch due to its simplicity and ease of use, and has a larger community of users.

4. **Flexibility**: PyTorch is more flexible than Keras and allows for more customizability and control over the model.

## Example code


```
import torch

x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([[0.7274, 0.9537, 0.9394],
        [0.7195, 0.7127, 0.9457],
        [0.7478, 0.9701, 0.6242],
        [0.7804, 0.8500, 0.7548],
        [0.7346, 0.7232, 0.4451]])
```

Ultimately, the decision of which framework to use will depend on the specific needs of the project. It is recommended to experiment with both frameworks to determine which one is best suited for the task.
