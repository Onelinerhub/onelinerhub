# How do I reshape data in Python using Keras?
// plain

Reshaping data in Python using Keras is a common task for deep learning models. It involves changing the dimensions of the data for the model to be able to interpret it correctly. This can be done using the `reshape()` function of the Keras library.

## Example

```
import numpy as np
from keras.layers import Input, Reshape

# Create the input data
data = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]])

# Reshape the input data to the desired shape
reshaped_data = Reshape((3, 3))(data)

# Print the reshaped data
print(reshaped_data)
```
## Output example

```
[[[1 2 3]
  [4 5 6]
  [7 8 9]]]
```

The code above consists of the following parts:
1. Importing the numpy and Keras libraries.
2. Creating the input data as a NumPy array.
3. Reshaping the data using the `reshape()` function.
4. Printing the reshaped data.
