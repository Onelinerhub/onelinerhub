# How do I use the model.fit function in Python Keras?
// plain

The model.fit function is a key function in Python Keras for training a model. It takes in a set of training data and trains the model on that data. The syntax for using model.fit is as follows:

```
model.fit(x=training_data, y=target_data, epochs=num_of_epochs, batch_size=batch_size)
```

- `x`: This is the input data, which is a numpy array containing the features of the training data.
- `y`: This is the target data, which is also a numpy array containing the labels of the training data.
- `epochs`: This is the number of times the model will iterate over the training data.
- `batch_size`: This is the number of samples that will be used in each iteration.

For example, if we have a training data set of 1000 samples and we want to train our model with 10 epochs and a batch size of 32, then we would use the following code:

```
model.fit(x=training_data, y=target_data, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

This will train the model on the training data for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.
