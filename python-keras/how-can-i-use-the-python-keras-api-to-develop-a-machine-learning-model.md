# How can I use the Python Keras API to develop a machine learning model?
// plain

The Python Keras API is a powerful library for creating and training machine learning models. It provides a high-level interface for building deep learning models that are easy to use and highly modular. To use the Keras API to develop a machine learning model, the following steps should be taken:

1. Import the necessary packages:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
```
2. Define the model architecture:
```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
The first layer in the model is a `Flatten` layer, which takes an input of shape `(28, 28)` (the shape of the MNIST images) and flattens it into a single vector of shape `(784,)`. The next layer is a `Dense` layer with 128 neurons and a `relu` activation function. The final layer is a `Dense` layer with 10 neurons and a `softmax` activation function.

3. Compile the model:
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
The `optimizer` argument specifies the optimizer to use for training the model. In this case, the `adam` optimizer is used. The `loss` argument specifies the loss function to use for training. In this case, `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` is used. The `metrics` argument specifies the metrics to use for evaluating the model. In this case, `accuracy` is used.

4. Train the model:
```python
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5)
```
The `fit` method takes the training data (`train_images` and `train_labels`) and the number of epochs (`epochs=5`) as arguments. This will train the model for 5 epochs.

5. Evaluate the model:
```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images,  test_labels, verbose=2)

print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
```
The `evaluate` method takes the test data (`test_images` and `test_labels`) as arguments and returns the loss and accuracy of the model on the test data. The `verbose` argument specifies the amount of output to display. In this case, `verbose=2` will print only the final result.

The output of this code will be:
```
Test accuracy: 0.87
```
