# How to use the PHPUnit Framework TestCase?
// plain

PHPUnit is a unit testing framework for the PHP programming language. It can be used to test individual classes and functions, as well as entire applications.

To use the PHPUnit Framework TestCase, you need to create a class that extends the PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase class. This class will contain all of your test methods.

```
class MyTestCase extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public function testSomething()
    {
        // Test code goes here
    }
}
```

The testSomething() method is an example of a test method. This method will contain the code that you want to test.

Once you have written your test methods, you can run them using the PHPUnit command line tool. The output of the command will show the results of the tests.
