# How to use hooks in PHPUnit?
// plain

Hooks are a powerful feature of PHPUnit that allow you to execute code before and after tests. They are especially useful for setting up and tearing down test fixtures.

## Example code

```
public function setUp()
{
    // Set up the test fixture
}

public function tearDown()
{
    // Tear down the test fixture
}
```

The `setUp()` method is called before each test, and the `tearDown()` method is called after each test. This allows you to create a test fixture that is used for each test, and then tear it down after the test is complete.

You can also use hooks to execute code before and after the entire test suite. The `setUpBeforeClass()` and `tearDownAfterClass()` methods are called before and after the entire test suite is executed.
