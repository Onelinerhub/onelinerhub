PHPUnit can be installed with a PHAR file using the following steps:

1. Download the latest version of the PHAR file from the [PHPUnit website](https://phpunit.de/).
2. Make the PHAR file executable by running the following command:
```
chmod +x phpunit.phar
```
3. Move the PHAR file to a directory in your `$PATH` environment variable.
4. Test the installation by running the following command:
```
phpunit.phar --version
```
5. The output should be something like this:
```
PHPUnit 8.5.2 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.
```

This completes the installation of PHPUnit with a PHAR file.
