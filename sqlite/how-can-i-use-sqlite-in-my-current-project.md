# How can I use SQLite in my current project?
// plain

SQLite is a lightweight, disk-based database that can be used in a variety of projects. It is open source, easy to set up, and can be used with a variety of programming languages. To use SQLite in your current project, you will need to install the SQLite library and create a database.

To install the SQLite library, you can use a package manager such as pip:
```
pip install sqlite3
```

Once the library is installed, you can create a database by connecting to it and creating a table:
```
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
c = conn.cursor()

c.execute("""CREATE TABLE users (
            user_id integer,
            name text,
            age integer
            )""")

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

Once the database is set up, you can use the SQLite library to insert, update, and delete data from the database. For example, you can use the following code to insert a new user into the database:
```
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
c = conn.cursor()

c.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'John', 20)")

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

For more information on SQLite and how to use it in your project, you can check out the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) and the [SQLite tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/).
