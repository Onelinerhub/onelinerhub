// plain

1. Download a SQLite reader. There are many available online, such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
2. Connect to a database using the SQLite reader. This can be done by clicking 'Open Database' and selecting the database file.
3. Execute SQL queries. For example, to view the contents of a table, the following query can be used:
```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
4. The output of the query will be displayed in the SQLite reader. For example, the output of the above query might be:
```
id  | name  | age
1   | John  | 24
2   | Sarah | 26
```
5. Create, modify and delete data from the database. This can be done by writing SQL statements such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE`.
6. Create, modify and delete tables and indexes from the database. This can be done by writing SQL statements such as `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE` and `DROP TABLE`.
7. Close the connection to the database. This can be done by clicking 'Close Database' in the SQLite reader.
