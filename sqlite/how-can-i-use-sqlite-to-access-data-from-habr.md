# How can I use SQLite to access data from Habr?
// plain

SQLite is a popular open source SQL database engine that can be used to access data from Habr. It is easy to use and has a small footprint, making it ideal for use in web applications.

To start using SQLite with Habr, you will need to download and install the [SQLite3 command-line shell](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).

Once you have installed SQLite, you can use the `sqlite3` command to open a connection to a database. For example, to open the Habr database, you can use:

```
sqlite3 habr.db
```

This will open a connection to the Habr database and allow you to start querying and manipulating data. For example, to query the Habr users table, you can use the following command:

```
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This will return a list of all users in the database.

You can also use SQLite to create, update, and delete data in the Habr database. For example, to create a new user, you can use the following command:

```
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'jdoe@example.com');
```

This will create a new user with the name "John Doe" and the email address "jdoe@example.com".

By using SQLite, you can easily access and manipulate data from Habr.
