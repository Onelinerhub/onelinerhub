How can I migrate my SQLite database to MySQL?
// plain

Migrating from SQLite to MySQL can be done using the `mysqldump` command line utility. The following example code will dump the contents of a SQLite database into a MySQL compatible format:

```
sqlite3 my_db.db .dump | mysql -u username -p dbname
```

This command will prompt you for a password for the MySQL database.

The command will create a new database and import the data from SQLite to the new MySQL database.

The following parts are used in the command:

* `sqlite3 my_db.db`: This part opens the SQLite database file and dumps its contents.
* `.dump`: This part prints out the content of the database in a format that can be used by MySQL.
* `mysql -u username -p dbname`: This part connects to the MySQL database and imports the data from the SQLite database.
