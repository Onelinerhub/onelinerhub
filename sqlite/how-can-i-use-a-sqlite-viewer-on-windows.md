# How can I use a SQLite viewer on Windows?
// plain

SQLite is a lightweight database that can be used to store data and query it for analysis. To view the contents of a SQLite database on Windows, you can use a SQLite viewer such as DB Browser for SQLite.

To use DB Browser for SQLite on Windows, you will need to download and install the program. Once installed, you can open a SQLite database file by clicking "File" and then "Open Database" from the menu.

Once the database is open, you can view the tables, columns, and data within the database. You can also use the "Execute SQL" tab to run SQL queries against the database.

For example, to view all the data within a table, you can run the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM [table_name];
```

This will output the data within the table, like this:

```
id	name	age
1	John	20
2	Mary	25
3	Dave	30
```

You can also use DB Browser for SQLite to edit and delete data, create new tables, and more.

For more information on using DB Browser for SQLite, please see the [documentation](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).
