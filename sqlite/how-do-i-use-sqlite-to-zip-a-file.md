# How do I use SQLite to zip a file?
// plain

SQLite does not have a built-in function for zipping a file. However, you can use the [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) module in Python to achieve this.

First, you need to import the sqlite3 module:
```
import sqlite3
```

Then, you need to create a connection to the database:
```
conn = sqlite3.connect("my_database.db")
```

Next, you need to create a cursor object, which will allow you to execute SQL commands:
```
c = conn.cursor()
```

You can then execute a SQL command to zip the file:
```
c.execute("SELECT * FROM my_table INTO OUTFILE 'my_zipped_file.zip'")
```

Finally, you need to commit the changes to the database and close the connection:
```
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

This example will create a zipped file named `my_zipped_file.zip` from the contents of the table `my_table` in the database `my_database.db`.
