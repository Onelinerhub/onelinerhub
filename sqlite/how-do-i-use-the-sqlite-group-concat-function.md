# How do I use the SQLite GROUP_CONCAT function?
// plain

The SQLite GROUP_CONCAT function is used to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single string.

It takes one argument, which is the value to be concatenated, and an optional separator argument, which is used to separate each value in the string.

The syntax for using the GROUP_CONCAT function is as follows:

```
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(column_name [, separator])
FROM table_name;
```

For example, if we have a table called `users` with two columns, `id` and `name`, we can use the GROUP_CONCAT function to concatenate all the names into a single string, separated by a comma:

```
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(name, ', ')
FROM users;
```

The output of this query would be a single string, containing all the names from the `users` table, separated by a comma.

For more information on the GROUP_CONCAT function, see the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#groupconcat).
