# How do I download SQLite?
// plain

1. SQLite is a popular open source database that can be downloaded for free from the [SQLite website](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
2. To download SQLite, navigate to the download page and select the precompiled binaries for your system.
3. You can also download the source code and compile it yourself by following the instructions on the download page.
4. Once you have downloaded the database, you can use the `sqlite3` command line tool to interact with the database.
5. For example, the following code will create a new database called `test.db`:

```
$ sqlite3 test.db
SQLite version 3.22.0 2018-01-22 18:45:57
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite>
```

6. You can also use the `sqlite3` command to execute SQL commands on the database, such as creating tables and inserting data.
