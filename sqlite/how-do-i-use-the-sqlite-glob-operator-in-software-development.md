# How do I use the SQLite GLOB operator in software development?
// plain

The GLOB operator in SQLite is used to compare text strings using patterns. It is a powerful tool for software development, as it enables developers to search for data in a database using wildcard characters.

## Example code

```
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE field_name GLOB 'pattern';
```

This example code will return all records from the table_name table where the field_name matches the pattern specified.

## Code explanation

1. SELECT * FROM table_name: This part of the code selects all records from the table_name table.
2. WHERE field_name GLOB 'pattern': This part of the code specifies the pattern to search for in the field_name field. The GLOB operator allows the use of wildcard characters such as `*` and `?` to match multiple characters.
3. 'pattern': This part of the code specifies the pattern to search for. This can be a string of characters or a wildcard pattern.
