# How do I use the SQLite zfill function?
// plain

The `zfill()` function in SQLite is used to pad a string with leading zeros. This is helpful when you need to ensure that all strings have a certain number of characters, such as when dealing with numeric codes or identifiers.

For example, the following code will pad a string with leading zeros to make it five characters long:
```
SELECT zfill('ABC', 5);
```
The output of this code would be `00ABC`.

The code consists of two parts:
- `zfill()`: the SQLite function used to pad a string with leading zeros
- `'ABC'`: the string to be padded
- `5`: the number of characters the string should be padded to

Here are a few more examples of `zfill()` in action:

```
SELECT zfill('123', 5);
```
The output of this code would be `00123`.

```
SELECT zfill('ABCD', 5);
```
The output of this code would be `ABCD`.

For more information about the `zfill()` function in SQLite, see the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#zfill).
