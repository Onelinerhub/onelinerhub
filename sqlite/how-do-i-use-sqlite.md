# How do I use SQLite?
// plain

SQLite is a popular open source SQL database engine that is designed for ease of use and portability. To use SQLite, you will need to download and install the SQLite library on your system.

Once the library is installed, you can create a database using a command line shell program. For example, the following command will create a database called "mydatabase.db":

```
$ sqlite3 mydatabase.db
```

You can then use SQL commands to create tables and insert data into the database. For example:

```
sqlite> CREATE TABLE users (name TEXT, age INTEGER);
sqlite> INSERT INTO users VALUES ('John', 25);
sqlite> INSERT INTO users VALUES ('Jane', 30);
```

You can then query the database using SQL commands. For example:

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM users;
John|25
Jane|30
```

In addition, you can write programs in various languages (such as C, Java, Python, etc.) that use the SQLite library to access and manipulate the database.

For more information on using SQLite, please refer to the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html).
