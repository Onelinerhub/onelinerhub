# How can I use multithreading to optimize SQLite queries?
// plain

Multithreading can be used to optimize SQLite queries by running multiple threads simultaneously. For example, the following code creates two threads to query an SQLite database:

```
import threading

def query_db1():
    # query the database

def query_db2():
    # query the database

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=query_db1)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=query_db2)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()
```

This code will run the `query_db1()` and `query_db2()` functions in two separate threads. This can lead to faster query execution, as the two queries can be run in parallel.

Additionally, it can also be useful to use thread-safe versions of the SQLite library. This ensures that queries are executed in a safe manner, even when multiple threads are running concurrently.

The following parts of the code are used to optimize SQLite queries with multithreading:

1. Importing the `threading` module to create threads.
2. Defining `query_db1()` and `query_db2()` functions to query the database.
3. Creating two `threading` objects and passing the query functions as arguments.
4. Starting the threads with `thread1.start()` and `thread2.start()`.
5. Using a thread-safe version of the SQLite library.
