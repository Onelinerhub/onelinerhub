# How can I use SQLite window functions in my software development project?
// plain

SQLite window functions are a powerful tool for performing complex calculations on data sets within an SQL query. They can be used in software development projects to simplify complex operations such as calculating running totals or ranking values.

For example, the following code block uses the `SUM()` window function to calculate a running total of the `quantity` column:

```
SELECT order_id, quantity,
  SUM(quantity) OVER (ORDER BY order_id ASC) AS running_total
FROM orders;
```

## Output example

```
order_id	quantity	running_total
1	        2	        2
2	        3	        5
3	        5	        10
```

The code works as follows:
1. The `SELECT` statement selects the `order_id`, `quantity` columns and a calculated `running_total` column.
2. The `SUM()` window function calculates the sum of the `quantity` column, ordered by `order_id`.
3. The `OVER` clause specifies the window frame, which is the set of rows used to calculate the sum.
4. The `ORDER BY` clause orders the window frame by `order_id`.

For more information on window functions, see the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html).
