# How can I use SQLite with Python to perform asynchronous operations?
// plain

SQLite is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that can be used with Python to perform asynchronous operations. To do this, the Python sqlite3 module can be used. The sqlite3 module provides an asynchronous interface to the SQLite database.

The following example code shows how to use the sqlite3 module to perform asynchronous operations:
```
import sqlite3

# Establish a connection to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor
c = conn.cursor()

# Execute an asynchronous query
c.execute('SELECT * FROM table_name')

# Fetch the results of the query
results = c.fetchall()

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

## Code explanation

1. Import the sqlite3 module
2. Establish a connection to the database
3. Create a cursor
4. Execute an asynchronous query
5. Fetch the results of the query
6. Close the connection
