# How do I exit SQLite?
// plain

SQLite is a lightweight database system that can be used as an embedded database. To exit SQLite, you can use the `.exit` command. This command will terminate the current interactive session and return you to the system command prompt.

For example, if you are using the sqlite3 command line utility, you can type the following command:

```
sqlite3> .exit
```

This will exit the sqlite3 utility and return you to the system command prompt.

You can also use the `Ctrl + D` keyboard shortcut to exit SQLite. This will also terminate the current interactive session and return you to the system command prompt.

The following are the parts of the code used to exit SQLite:

1. `.exit` - This is the command used to exit SQLite.
2. `Ctrl + D` - This is the keyboard shortcut used to exit SQLite.
