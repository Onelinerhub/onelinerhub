# How can SQLite and ZFS be used together for software development?
// plain

SQLite and ZFS can be used together for software development to provide a secure and reliable database solution.

For example, SQLite can be used to store data in a database and ZFS can be used to manage the storage of the database. This combination of technologies can provide a robust and secure environment for software development.

The following code block shows how to create a new database file using SQLite and ZFS:

```
# Create a new database file
sqlite3 my_db.db

# Create a ZFS pool
zpool create my_pool /dev/sda

# Create a ZFS filesystem
zfs create my_pool/my_db

# Mount the filesystem
mount -t zfs my_pool/my_db /mnt/my_db

# Copy the database file to the filesystem
cp my_db.db /mnt/my_db
```

The code above creates a new database file using SQLite, creates a ZFS pool, creates a ZFS filesystem, mounts the filesystem, and finally copies the database file to the filesystem.

The combination of SQLite and ZFS provides a secure and reliable environment for software development. It also allows for easy backup and recovery of the database files, as well as providing a more efficient way of managing the storage of the database.
