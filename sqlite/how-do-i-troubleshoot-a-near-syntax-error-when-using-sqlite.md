# How do I troubleshoot a near syntax error when using SQLite?
// plain

To troubleshoot a near syntax error when using SQLite, the following steps should be taken:

1. Carefully review the SQL query for any syntax errors, such as incorrect quotation marks, missing commas, or incorrect column names.

2. If the syntax appears correct, try running the query in an SQLite shell or web-based SQLite editor. This will allow you to run the query and see the exact error message, which can help pinpoint the issue.

3. If the query is still not running, check to make sure the database you are using is properly connected and that the table and column names are correct.

4. If the query still isn't running, try breaking it down into smaller pieces and running them separately. This will help you identify the exact part of the query that is causing the syntax error.

5. If the syntax error is still not resolved, try using the SQLite [documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) to review the syntax of the query and make sure it is correct.

6. If the syntax error still persists, try searching online for similar errors and solutions.

7. If the error persists, reach out to the SQLite community for help.

Example code block:
```
SELECT * FROM table WHERE col = 'val'
```

## Output example

```
Error: near "val": syntax error
```

## Code explanation

- `SELECT`: This is the keyword used to specify that data should be retrieved from the database.
- `*`: This is a wildcard character used to select all columns from the specified table.
- `FROM`: This is the keyword used to specify the table from which data should be retrieved.
- `WHERE`: This is the keyword used to specify a condition that must be met for the data to be retrieved.
- `col`: This is the name of the column to be used in the condition.
- `=`: This is the operator used to compare the value of the column to the specified value.
- `val`: This is the value to be compared to the value in the column.
