# How do I use SQLite triggers in my software development project?
// plain

SQLite triggers are an important part of software development projects. Triggers are pieces of code that are executed when a certain event occurs in the database. They are used to automate tasks and help maintain data integrity.

For example, the following SQLite trigger will insert a new row into the `log` table each time a row is inserted into the `users` table:
```
CREATE TRIGGER log_user_insert AFTER INSERT ON users
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO log (user_id, action) VALUES (new.id, 'insert');
END;
```

The code consists of the following parts:

- `CREATE TRIGGER`: This is the command used to create a trigger.
- `log_user_insert`: This is the name of the trigger.
- `AFTER INSERT ON users`: This specifies when the trigger should be executed. In this case, it will be executed after a row is inserted into the `users` table.
- `INSERT INTO log`: This is the action that will be taken when the trigger is executed. In this case, it will insert a row into the `log` table.
- `VALUES (new.id, 'insert')`: This specifies the values for the row that will be inserted. In this case, it will be the `id` of the row that was inserted into the `users` table, and the value `insert`.
