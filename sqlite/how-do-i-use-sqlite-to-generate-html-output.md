# How do I use SQLite to generate HTML output?
// plain

SQLite is a relational database management system that can be used to generate HTML output. To do this, you can use the `.output` command to write the output of a query to a file in HTML format. For example, the following code will write the output of a query to a file called "output.html":

```
.output output.html
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

You can also use the `.mode` command to set the output mode to HTML. This will cause the output of a query to be formatted as HTML. For example:

```
.mode html
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

The output of the query will be formatted as HTML.

You can also use the `.header` and `.footer` commands to add a header and footer to the output. For example:

```
.header on
.footer on
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

The output of the query will be preceded and followed by a header and footer.

Finally, you can use the `.html` command to write the output of a query to a file in HTML format. For example:

```
.html output.html
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

This will write the output of the query to a file called "output.html" in HTML format.
