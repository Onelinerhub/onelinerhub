# How can I use the SQLite Pragma command?
// plain

The SQLite Pragma command is used to query and set various parameters and flags within the SQLite environment. It is a non-standard extension to the SQL language, and provides access to various configuration settings and performance-related features.

The syntax of the Pragma command is:

```
PRAGMA [database.]pragma-name [= value]
```

Where `pragma-name` is the name of the pragma and `value` is an optional parameter.

For example, to check the auto-vacuum mode of a database, the following command can be used:

```
PRAGMA auto_vacuum;
```

The output of this command will be either `0` (no auto-vacuum), `1` (full auto-vacuum) or `2` (incremental auto-vacuum).

The Pragma command can also be used to set various flags, such as the synchronous flag, which determines how often data is written to the disk:

```
PRAGMA synchronous=OFF;
```

The output of this command will be `OK`.

The Pragma command is an essential tool for managing and optimizing SQLite databases. For more information, see the [SQLite Pragma documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html).
