# How do I use the SQLite round function?
// plain

The SQLite round function is used to round a number to a specific number of digits. It takes two arguments, the first being the number to be rounded and the second being the number of decimal places to round to.

## Example code

```
SELECT round(3.14159, 2);
```

## Output example

```
3.14
```

The code above rounds the number 3.14159 to two decimal places, resulting in the output of 3.14.
