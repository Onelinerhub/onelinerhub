# How do I use the SQLite CONCAT function?
// plain

The SQLite CONCAT function is used to concatenate two or more strings together into a single string. It takes two or more strings as arguments and returns a single string that is the result of combining all of the arguments together.

For example, the following code ```SELECT CONCAT('Hello ', 'World')``` will return the string `Hello World`.

## Code explanation

- `SELECT`: This is the SQL keyword used to indicate that a query is being made.
- `CONCAT`: This is the function being used.
- `'Hello '` and `'World'`: These are the strings being concatenated together.

The CONCAT function can also be used to concatenate multiple strings together. For example, the following code ```SELECT CONCAT('Hello ', 'World', '!')``` will return the string `Hello World!`.
