# How do I use SQLite with Zephyr?
// plain

SQLite is an open source database library that can be used with Zephyr. It allows developers to store and retrieve data from a database without having to use a full-fledged database server.

To use SQLite with Zephyr, you must first install the library on your system. This can be done with the following command:

```
$ pip install sqlite3
```

Once the library is installed, you can use the SQLite API to create and interact with a database. For example, the following code will create a database named "test.db" and create a table named "users":

```
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("test.db")
c = conn.cursor()

c.execute("CREATE TABLE users (name text, age integer)")

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

The above code will create a database file named "test.db" with a table named "users". You can then use SQLite commands to insert, update, and delete data from the table.

Finally, you can use the SQLite API to query the database. For example, the following code will query the "users" table and return all records:

```
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("test.db")
c = conn.cursor()

c.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

rows = c.fetchall()

for row in rows:
    print(row)

conn.close()
```

The above code will output the following:

```
('John', 25)
('Jane', 22)
('Bob', 27)
```

Using SQLite with Zephyr is a straightforward process. Once the library is installed, you can use the SQLite API to create and interact with a database. You can then use SQLite commands to insert, update, and delete data from the database and query the database for records.
