# How do I add a column to a SQLite database?
// plain

To add a column to a SQLite database, you must use the `ALTER TABLE` statement. This statement allows you to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

For example, to add a new column called 'PhoneNumber' to the 'Employees' table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD COLUMN PhoneNumber VARCHAR(20);
```

The above statement will add a new column called `PhoneNumber` to the `Employees` table with a data type of `VARCHAR(20)`, which is a string of up to 20 characters.

The parts of the statement are:
- `ALTER TABLE`: This is the statement that tells SQLite to modify an existing table.
- `Employees`: This is the name of the table that you want to modify.
- `ADD COLUMN`: This tells SQLite to add a new column to the table.
- `PhoneNumber`: This is the name of the new column that you are adding.
- `VARCHAR(20)`: This is the data type of the new column.

No output will be generated by this statement.
