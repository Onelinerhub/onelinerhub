# How can I use SQLite with Kubernetes?
// plain

SQLite can be used with Kubernetes in a number of ways.

1. A SQLite database can be packaged as a Docker image and deployed as a Kubernetes Pod. This allows for easy scaling, replication, and availability of the database.

2. SQLite can be used as an ephemeral database inside a Kubernetes Deployment. This allows for the database to be recreated on each deployment, ensuring that the data is fresh and up-to-date.

3. SQLite can be used as a persistent database in a Kubernetes StatefulSet. This allows the data to be stored outside of the pod, and can be accessed from multiple pods.

4. SQLite can be used as a database in a Kubernetes Service. This allows for the database to be accessed from multiple pods, and can be used to store application state.

## Example code


```
# Create a Kubernetes Pod for SQLite
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sqlite-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: sqlite
    image: sqlite
```

This example code creates a Kubernetes Pod for a SQLite database.

## Code explanation


- apiVersion: v1: This is the version of the Kubernetes API that is being used.
- kind: Pod: This is the type of Kubernetes object that is being created.
- metadata: This is a set of labels and other information about the Kubernetes object.
- name: sqlite-pod: This is the name of the Kubernetes object.
- spec: This is a set of configuration options for the Kubernetes object.
- containers: This is a list of container images that will be used in the Kubernetes object.
- name: sqlite: This is the name of the container image.
- image: sqlite: This is the name of the container image.
