# How do I use SQLite to find the maximum value of a field?
// plain

To use SQLite to find the maximum value of a field, the following code can be used:

```
SELECT MAX(field_name) FROM table_name;
```

This code will return the maximum value of the specified field.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `SELECT`: This keyword is used to retrieve data from a table.
2. `MAX(field_name)`: This part of the code specifies the field whose maximum value is to be found.
3. `FROM table_name`: This part of the code specifies the table from which the data is to be retrieved.
