# How do I set up a SQLite server?
// plain

Setting up a SQLite server is relatively simple.

1. First, install the SQLite3 package for your operating system. On Ubuntu, this can be done with the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
```

2. Next, create a database file. This can be done with the following command:
```
sqlite3 example.db
```
This will create a file named example.db in your current working directory.

3. Once the database file is created, you can create tables and insert data into them. For example:
```
CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('John');
```

4. To access the data in the database, you can use the `SELECT` statement. For example:
```
SELECT * FROM users;
```
This will output the data in the users table:
```
1|John
```

5. Finally, you can use the `.quit` command to exit the SQLite3 shell.
