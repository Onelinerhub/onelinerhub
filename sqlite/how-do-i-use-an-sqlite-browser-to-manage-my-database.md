// plain

Using an SQLite browser to manage your database is a simple process.

First, you will need to download and install an SQLite browser. For example, you can use the [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

Once you have the browser installed, you can open your database by clicking on `File > Open Database` and selecting the file.

You can then use the browser to manage your database. This includes creating new tables, modifying existing tables, adding or deleting data, running queries, and more.

For example, to create a new table, you can click on `File > New > Table` and enter the table name and column definitions.

You can also use the browser to run queries. For example, the following query will return the contents of the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

The output of this query will be a table containing the contents of the `users` table.

In addition, you can use the browser to export your database to a file or to another database format. This can be done by clicking on `File > Export > Database to SQL file` and selecting the file format.

Finally, you can use the browser to add or delete users, set permissions, and more.
