# How do I create a SQLite tutorial?
// plain

1. Create a text document for the tutorial. This document should include a brief introduction to SQLite, an overview of the database structure, and instructions for setting up and running the database.

2. Add example code blocks to the document. Code blocks should be enclosed with backticks (\`\`\`) to indicate that they are code snippets. For example:

\`\`\`
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);
\`\`\`

3. Explain the code parts in detail. For example, explain what the CREATE TABLE command does, what the id and name fields are used for, and how the PRIMARY KEY constraint works.

4. Include output of any example code. For example, the output of the CREATE TABLE command above would be something like:

\`\`\`
Table "users" created successfully.
\`\`\`

5. Provide a step-by-step guide to running the database. This should include instructions on how to create and populate tables, run queries, and perform other operations.

6. Provide a list of helpful links. These links should be to external resources such as tutorials, reference documents, and SQLite documentation.

7. Test the tutorial. Run through the tutorial yourself and check that all the steps work as expected. Make sure to include any corrections or updates in the final version.
