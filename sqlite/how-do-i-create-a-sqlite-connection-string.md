# How do I create a SQLite connection string?
// plain

A SQLite connection string is used to connect to a SQLite database. It is a string of parameters that define the connection parameters to the database.

The format of the connection string is as follows:

```
sqlite://<database_name>
```

Where `<database_name>` is the name of the database to connect to.

An example connection string is:

```
sqlite://my_database.db
```

The following code will create a connection to the database using the connection string:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('sqlite://my_database.db')
```

The parts of the code are:
- `import sqlite3`: imports the sqlite3 library, which is needed to connect to the database.
- `sqlite3.connect('sqlite://my_database.db')`: creates a connection to the database specified in the connection string.
