How can I optimize SQLite memory usage?
// plain

SQLite memory usage can be optimized by using the following techniques:

1. Use the `PRAGMA cache_size` command to set the maximum number of database pages that can be held in memory. This will reduce the amount of memory used by SQLite.

```
sqlite> PRAGMA cache_size = 1000;
```

2. Use the `PRAGMA page_size` command to set the page size for the database. Smaller page sizes will reduce the amount of memory used by SQLite.

```
sqlite> PRAGMA page_size = 1024;
```

3. Use the `PRAGMA temp_store` command to set the location of the temporary store. Setting this to `memory` will ensure that all temporary files are stored in memory, reducing the amount of memory used by SQLite.

```
sqlite> PRAGMA temp_store = memory;
```

4. Use the `PRAGMA journal_mode` command to set the journal mode for the database. Setting this to `off` will reduce the amount of memory used by SQLite.

```
sqlite> PRAGMA journal_mode = off;
```

5. Use the `PRAGMA synchronous` command to set the synchronous mode for the database. Setting this to `off` will reduce the amount of memory used by SQLite.

```
sqlite> PRAGMA synchronous = off;
```

These techniques will help optimize the memory usage of SQLite.
