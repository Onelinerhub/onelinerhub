# How do I use an online SQLite viewer?
// plain

1. To use an online SQLite viewer, first you need to create a database file and save it in the SQLite format. To do this, you can use the `sqlite3` command line tool.

2. Once you have the database file, you can open it with an online SQLite viewer such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

3. When you open the viewer, you can create and execute SQL queries on the database. For example, you can use the following query to select all records from a table called `users`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

4. This query will return a result set containing all records from the `users` table.

5. You can also use the SQLite viewer to create and modify tables, add and delete records, and perform other database operations.

6. If you want to learn more about using an online SQLite viewer, you can check out the [SQLite Tutorials](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/) and [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html).

7. You can also find many helpful resources about SQLite online, such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sqlite) and [SQLite Forum](https://www.sqlite.org/forum/).
