// plain

SQLite Studio is a free and open source software for managing SQLite databases. It is a cross-platform application that can be used to create, modify and delete SQLite databases and tables. It supports SQLite version 3 and 4.

To use SQLite Studio to manage your database, you need to first create a database either from the graphical user interface or from the command line. To create a database from the GUI, open SQLite Studio and click on the ‘Create Database’ button. You will be prompted to enter a database name and a location to save it. After the database is created, you can start adding tables to it.

To create a table, open the database and click on the ‘Create Table’ button. You will be prompted to enter the table name and the column names and types. You can also add constraints to the columns. Once the table is created, you can start entering data into it.

To enter data, open the table and click on the ‘Insert Row’ button. You will be prompted to enter the data for each column. Once the data is entered, you can save the changes by clicking on the ‘Save’ button.

You can also use SQLite Studio to modify existing data in the database. To do this, open the table and click on the ‘Edit’ button. You will be prompted to enter the new data for the selected column. Once the data is entered, you can save the changes by clicking on the ‘Save’ button.

You can also use SQLite Studio to delete data from the database. To do this, open the table and click on the ‘Delete’ button. You will be prompted to select the rows that you want to delete. Once the rows are selected, you can delete them by clicking on the ‘Delete’ button.

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

## Output example
