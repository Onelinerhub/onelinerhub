# How do I use the correct syntax for SQLite?
// plain

SQLite is a powerful and easy to use database engine. To use it correctly, you need to understand the syntax of the SQL language. Here is an example of a basic SQL query:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

This query will select all columns from the specified table. To use more complex queries, you need to use the following syntax:

* `SELECT`: This clause is used to specify which columns you want to select from the table.
* `FROM`: This clause is used to specify the table or tables from which you want to select data.
* `WHERE`: This clause is used to specify conditions for selecting data.
* `ORDER BY`: This clause is used to specify how the data should be sorted.
* `LIMIT`: This clause is used to limit the number of rows returned.

For example, the following query will select only the columns `name` and `age` from the `users` table, and will sort the results in ascending order by age:

```
SELECT name, age FROM users ORDER BY age ASC;
```

For more information about SQLite syntax, you can refer to the [SQLite documentation](https://sqlite.org/docs.html).
