# How can I get started with SQLite data packs?
// plain

1. Install SQLite:
To get started with SQLite data packs, you must first install SQLite. The easiest way to do this is to download the pre-compiled binaries from the [SQLite Download Page](https://sqlite.org/download.html).

2. Create a Database:
Once SQLite is installed, you can create a database by running the following command in the command line:
```
sqlite3 my_database.db
```

3. Create Tables:
Now that you have a database, you can create tables within it. This is done by writing SQL commands. For example:
```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

4. Insert Data:
Once the table is created, you can insert data into it. This is done with the INSERT command. For example:
```
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```

5. Query Data:
You can query data from the database using the SELECT command. For example:
```
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This will return all of the data from the users table.

6. Export Data:
Finally, you can export the data from your database into a data pack. This is done using the .dump command. For example:
```
.dump
```

This will output the entire contents of the database in a data pack format.

7. Resources:
