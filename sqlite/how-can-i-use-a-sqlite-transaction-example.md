# How can I use a SQLite transaction example?
// plain

A SQLite transaction is a way to ensure data consistency and integrity when making changes to a database. It allows multiple changes to be grouped together and either all changes are applied or none are applied.

Below is an example of a SQLite transaction:

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE table_name
SET field_name = 'some_value'
WHERE condition;

INSERT INTO table_name (field_name)
VALUES ('some_value');

COMMIT;
```

The code above begins a transaction, updates a field in a table, inserts a new record into a table, and then commits the transaction.

The list below explains the parts of the code:
* `BEGIN TRANSACTION;` - starts the transaction
* `UPDATE table_name` - updates a field in a table
* `SET field_name = 'some_value'` - sets the field to a specific value
* `WHERE condition;` - specifies the condition for the update
* `INSERT INTO table_name (field_name)` - inserts a new record into a table
* `VALUES ('some_value');` - sets the value of the field
* `COMMIT;` - commits the transaction

No output is generated from the example above.
