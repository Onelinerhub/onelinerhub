# How do I use the SQLite documentation to develop software?
// plain

The [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) is a great resource for developing software with SQLite. It contains a wealth of information about the SQLite language, its syntax, and its usage.

To use the documentation to develop software, you can read through the topics to gain an understanding of the language and its usage. The documentation also contains many code examples and step-by-step tutorials, which can help you get started quickly.

For example, the [Getting Started](https://www.sqlite.org/quickstart.html) page contains a code snippet to create a new database:

```sql
sqlite3 test.db
```

This command creates a new SQLite database named `test.db`.

The documentation also contains a [complete reference](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) of the SQLite language, which can help you understand the syntax and usage of the language.

You can also use the [SQLite API](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/funclist.html) to interact with the database programmatically. The API contains a list of functions that can be used to query and manipulate the database.

Finally, the documentation also contains many [use cases](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html) that can help you understand how to use SQLite in different scenarios.
