# How do I use regular expressions to query a SQLite database?
// plain

Regular expressions can be used in SQLite queries to perform powerful pattern matching. The `LIKE` operator is used to match a string against a pattern. For example, the following SQLite statement will return all rows where the column `name` starts with the letter 'A':

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

The `%` operator is a wildcard that matches any number of characters. Other operators that can be used in regular expressions are `_` which matches any single character, `[...]` which matches any single character that is enclosed in the brackets, and `[^...]` which matches any single character that is not enclosed in the brackets.

The `REGEXP` operator can also be used to match a string against a regular expression pattern. For example, the following SQLite statement will return all rows where the column `name` contains the letter 'A':

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE name REGEXP '.*A.*';
```
