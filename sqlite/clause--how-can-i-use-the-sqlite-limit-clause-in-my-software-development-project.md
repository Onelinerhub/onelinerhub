How can I use the SQLite LIMIT clause in my software development project?
// plain

The SQLite LIMIT clause is used to limit the number of rows that are returned in a query result. It is often used in conjunction with the ORDER BY clause to return the top or bottom N rows of a query result. To use the SQLite LIMIT clause in a software development project, the following syntax should be used:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name
LIMIT N;
```

Where `N` is the number of rows to be returned. For example, the following query will return the top 10 rows of the `products` table sorted by price in descending order:

```
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The following parts are used in the SQLite LIMIT clause:

* `SELECT` - This keyword is used to retrieve data from a database table.
* `*` - This is a wildcard character used to select all columns from the table.
* `FROM` - This keyword is used to specify the table from which data is retrieved.
* `ORDER BY` - This clause is used to sort the query result in ascending or descending order.
* `LIMIT` - This clause is used to limit the number of rows returned in the query result.
