SQLite Database Browser is a free, open-source GUI tool for SQLite databases. It is used to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.

To use the SQLite Database Browser, first download and install the software from the official website. Then open the application and create a new database file.

Next, create the tables and fields for the database. You can do this by clicking the “Create Table” button in the toolbar. Enter the table name, fields, and data types for each field.

Once the tables and fields are created, you can enter data into the database. To do this, click the “Browse Data” tab. Then enter the data into each field.

You can also use the SQLite Database Browser to execute SQL queries. To do this, click the “Execute SQL” tab. Then enter the query and click “Run SQL”.

For example, if you wanted to select all records from a table, you could use the following code:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

The output of the query would be all of the records from the table.
