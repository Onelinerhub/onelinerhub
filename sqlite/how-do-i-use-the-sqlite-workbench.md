# How do I use the SQLite Workbench?
// plain

SQLite Workbench is an open source tool for managing SQLite databases. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage databases, tables, and views.

To use SQLite Workbench, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version from the [SQLite website](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

Once installed, you can open the SQLite Workbench GUI and connect to a database. You can create a new database or connect to an existing one.

Once connected to a database, you can use the GUI to run SQL queries. For example, to create a table, you can run the following query:

```
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);
```

The output of this query will be the following:

```
Query executed successfully in 0.001 seconds.
```

You can also use the GUI to view and edit the data in your tables. You can also use it to create views, indexes, and triggers.

SQLite Workbench also provides a range of other useful features, such as an SQL editor, query builder, and data import/export.

For more information about SQLite Workbench, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://sqliteworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
