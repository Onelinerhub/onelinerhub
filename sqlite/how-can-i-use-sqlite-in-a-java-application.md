# How can I use SQLite in a Java application?
// plain

SQLite is an open-source, embedded relational database management system that can be used in Java applications. To use SQLite in a Java application, you need to include the JDBC driver for SQLite in your project. The following example shows how to connect to a SQLite database and execute a simple query:

```java
// Load the SQLite JDBC driver
Class.forName("org.sqlite.JDBC");

// Connect to the database
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:test.db");

// Execute a query
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT name FROM users");

// Iterate over the results
while (resultSet.next()) {
  System.out.println(resultSet.getString("name"));
}
```

This code will output the names of all users in the database.

The code consists of the following parts:
1. Loading the JDBC driver for SQLite: `Class.forName("org.sqlite.JDBC");`
2. Connecting to the database: `Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:test.db");`
3. Executing a query: `Statement statement = connection.createStatement(); ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT name FROM users");`
4. Iterating over the results: `while (resultSet.next()) { System.out.println(resultSet.getString("name")); }`
