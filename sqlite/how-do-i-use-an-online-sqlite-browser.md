# How do I use an online SQLite browser?
// plain

Using an online SQLite browser is a convenient way to view and analyze the contents of a SQLite database. It can be done by accessing a website such as [SQLiteOnline](https://sqliteonline.com/) which provides a web-based graphical interface for SQLite databases.

To use the online SQLite browser, you will need to upload the SQLite database file to the website. Once uploaded, you can then use the browser to explore the contents of the database.

For example, you can execute SQL queries to view the tables, columns, and data stored in the database. Here is an example query to view the table structure of a database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sqlite_master;
```

This query will return the following output:

```
table|name|tbl_name|rootpage|sql
table|sqlite_sequence|sqlite_sequence|3|CREATE TABLE sqlite_sequence(name,seq)
table|Employee|Employee|4|CREATE TABLE Employee(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,name TEXT,age INTEGER)
```

The output shows the name of the table, the table name, the root page, and the SQL statement used to create the table.

You can also use the browser to execute other SQL queries such as SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. For example, here is a query to select all the records from the Employee table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee;
```

This query will return the following output:

```
id|name|age
1|John|35
2|Jane|28
3|Jack|32
```

Using an online SQLite browser is an easy and convenient way to view and analyze the contents of a SQLite database.
