# How do I open a database with SQLite?
// plain

1. To open a database with SQLite, you need to first create a connection to the database. This can be done using the `sqlite3.connect()` function, which takes the name of the database file as an argument. For example:

```
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
```

2. Once the connection is established, you can use the `cursor()` method to create a cursor object which can be used to execute SQL commands. For example:

```
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

3. Once the cursor object is created, you can use the `execute()` method to execute SQL commands. For example:

```
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM my_table')
```

4. The `fetchall()` method can be used to fetch all the rows from the result set. For example:

```
rows = cursor.fetchall()
```

5. Finally, the `close()` method can be used to close the connection to the database. For example:

```
conn.close()
```

6. More information about SQLite and how to use it can be found in the [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html).

7. A tutorial on how to use SQLite in Python can be found in the [Python SQLite Tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/).
