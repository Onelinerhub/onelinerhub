# How can I use SQLite with Python to create a database?
// plain

Using SQLite with Python is a great way to create a database. SQLite is a lightweight database that is easy to set up and use. Here is an example of how to create a database using Python and SQLite:

```
import sqlite3

# Create a connection to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect("mydatabase.db")

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (title TEXT, author TEXT, year INTEGER)")

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

This code will create a database called `mydatabase.db` with a table called `books`. The table will have three columns: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* `import sqlite3`: imports the SQLite library into Python.
* `conn = sqlite3.connect("mydatabase.db")`: creates a connection to the database.
* `cursor = conn.cursor()`: creates a cursor object that will be used to execute queries.
* `cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (title TEXT, author TEXT, year INTEGER)")`: executes a query to create a table called `books` with three columns: `title`, `author`, and `year`.
* `conn.commit()`: commits the changes to the database.
* `conn.close()`: closes the connection to the database.
