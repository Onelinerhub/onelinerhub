# How can I use SQLite with Swift for software development?
// plain

SQLite is a light-weight, open-source, relational database system that can be used with Swift for software development. To use SQLite with Swift, the SQLite.swift library can be used. This library provides a wrapper around the SQLite C API, allowing for easy integration with Swift code.

Here is an example of using SQLite with Swift to create a table:

```swift
import SQLite

let db = try Connection("path/to/db.sqlite3")

let users = Table("users")
let id = Expression<Int64>("id")
let name = Expression<String>("name")
let email = Expression<String>("email")

try db.run(users.create { t in
    t.column(id, primaryKey: true)
    t.column(name)
    t.column(email, unique: true)
})
```

This code creates a table called "users" with three columns: "id", "name", and "email". The "id" column is the primary key and the "email" column is set to be unique.
