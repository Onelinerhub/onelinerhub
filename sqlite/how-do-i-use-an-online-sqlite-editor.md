# How do I use an online SQLite editor?

Using an online SQLite editor is a great way to quickly test out SQL queries and commands without having to install and configure a local SQLite database.

To use an online SQLite editor, you will first need to find a web-based SQLite editor. [SQLiteOnline](https://sqliteonline.com/) is a popular one. Once you have the editor open, you can start writing SQL queries.

For example, the following query will create a table named `users`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

This query will output the following:

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

Once the table is created, you can start inserting data. The following query will insert a user with the name `John` and an age of `25`:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('John', 25);
```

This query will output the following:

```
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

You can then query the table to get the data back. The following query will get all users from the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This query will output the following:

```
id	name	age
1	John	25
```

Using an online SQLite editor is a great way to quickly test out SQL queries and commands without having to install and configure a local SQLite database.
