# How do I create a view in SQLite?
// plain

Creating a view in SQLite is a fairly straightforward process. The basic syntax is as follows:

```
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition];
```

For example, if we have a table called `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `age` and we want to create a view called `employees_over_30` that only shows employees over 30 years old, we can use the following code:

```
CREATE VIEW employees_over_30 AS
SELECT id, name
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30;
```

The above code creates a view called `employees_over_30` that only shows the `id` and `name` of employees over 30 years old.

The parts of the code are as follows:
* `CREATE VIEW` - tells SQLite to create a view
* `employees_over_30` - the name of the view we are creating
* `SELECT id, name` - the columns we want to include in the view
* `FROM employees` - the table we are selecting from
* `WHERE age > 30` - the condition that the view should satisfy

More information on creating views in SQLite can be found in the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createview.html).
