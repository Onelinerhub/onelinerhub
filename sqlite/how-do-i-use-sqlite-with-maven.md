# How do I use SQLite with Maven?
// plain

SQLite is a lightweight, open-source, relational database management system. It can be used with Maven by adding the SQLite JDBC driver to the project's classpath. The following example code shows how to do this:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>
    <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>3.21.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

This code adds the SQLite JDBC driver as a dependency to the project. Once it is included in the project's classpath, it can be used to connect to a SQLite database and execute SQL queries. The following example code shows how to do this:

```
Class.forName("org.sqlite.JDBC");
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:test.db");
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");

while (resultSet.next()) {
    System.out.println(resultSet.getString("name"));
}
```

This code connects to a SQLite database called `test.db`, executes a query to retrieve all users, and prints out their names.

Using SQLite with Maven is a straightforward process. All that is needed is to add the SQLite JDBC driver to the project's classpath, and then connect to the database and execute SQL queries.

## Code explanation


1. `<dependency>` - This code adds the SQLite JDBC driver as a dependency to the project.
2. `Class.forName("org.sqlite.JDBC");` - This code loads the SQLite JDBC driver.
3. `Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:test.db");` - This code establishes a connection to the SQLite database `test.db`.
4. `Statement statement = connection.createStatement();` - This code creates a statement object that can be used to execute SQL queries.
5. `ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");` - This code executes a query to retrieve all users from the database.
6. `System.out.println(resultSet.getString("name"));` - This code prints out the names of the users that were retrieved from the database.
