# How do I use SQLite with Visual Studio?
// plain

SQLite is a lightweight, open source database that can be used with Visual Studio. It is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.

To use SQLite with Visual Studio, you need to install the [SQLite/SQL Server Compact Toolbox extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErikEJ.SqlCeToolbox). This extension adds several features to Visual Studio, including the ability to connect to and manage SQLite databases.

Once the extension is installed, you can create a new SQLite database in Visual Studio by right-clicking on the App_Data folder in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Add New Item". Select the "SQLite/SQL Server Compact" option and click "Add".

You can then open the database in Visual Studio and execute SQL commands. For example, the following code creates a new table in the database:

```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

The output of the above code should be a message indicating that the table was successfully created.

You can also use Visual Studio to view and edit the data in the database. To do this, right-click on the database in the Solution Explorer and select "View Data". This will open a window showing the contents of the database.

SQLite can also be used with other programming languages, such as C# and JavaScript. For more information on using SQLite with Visual Studio, see the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html).
