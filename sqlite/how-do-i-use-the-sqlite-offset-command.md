# How do I use the SQLite offset command?
// plain

The SQLite `OFFSET` command is used to skip a certain number of rows from the beginning of the result set. This command is used in conjunction with the `LIMIT` command to return a subset of the result set.

For example, if you wanted to return the 3rd, 4th, and 5th row from the result set, you could use the following command:
```
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;
```

The output of this command would be the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rows from the result set.

The syntax for the `OFFSET` command is as follows:
```
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT limit_value OFFSET offset_value;
```

- `SELECT`: This is the keyword used to select data from a database.
- `*`: This is a wildcard character used to select all columns from the specified table.
- `FROM`: This keyword is used to specify which table to select data from.
- `LIMIT`: This keyword is used to specify the number of rows to return in the result set.
- `OFFSET`: This keyword is used to skip a certain number of rows from the beginning of the result set.
- `limit_value`: This is a numerical value that specifies the number of rows to return in the result set.
- `offset_value`: This is a numerical value that specifies the number of rows to skip from the beginning of the result set.
