# How do I decide between using SQLite and MySQL for my software development project?
// plain

The decision between using SQLite and MySQL for software development projects depends on the particular project requirements.

SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained database that is well-suited for smaller projects. It is a serverless, zero-configuration, and transactional SQL database engine. It is typically used in mobile applications and web browsers.

MySQL is a more robust relational database management system. It is used for larger projects and is more suited for production environments. It requires a server and is more secure than SQLite.

Below is an example of a Python script that connects to a MySQL database:

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="user",
  passwd="password"
)

print(mydb)
# Output: <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x7f3c1f1a18d0>
```

The `mysql.connector` module is imported to connect to the database. The `host`, `user`, and `passwd` parameters are required to connect to the MySQL database. The output of the `print` statement confirms that the connection to the database was successful.

To decide between SQLite and MySQL for a software development project, consider the following factors:

- What is the size of the project?
- What type of environment is the project being developed for (e.g. production, development, etc)?
- Does the project require a server?
- Does the project require a secure database?
