# How can I use SQLite with Xamarin?
// plain

SQLite is a lightweight and open-source database engine that can be used with Xamarin. It is an ideal choice for mobile applications as it does not require a server and can store data locally.

To use SQLite with Xamarin, you will need to install the [SQLite.Net-PCL NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/sqlite-net-pcl/). This package provides a basic ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for working with SQLite databases.

You can then use the following code to create a database and a table:

```
// Create a connection to the database
var db = new SQLiteConnection(dbPath);

// Create a table
db.CreateTable<TodoItem>();
```

You can then use the following code to insert data into the table:

```
// Create an item to insert
var item = new TodoItem { Name = "Demo Item", Description = "This is a demo item" };

// Insert the item
db.Insert(item);
```

You can also use the following code to query the table:

```
// Query the table
var query = db.Table<TodoItem>().Where(v => v.Name == "Demo Item");

// Iterate the results
foreach (var result in query)
    Console.WriteLine("Name: " + result.Name + " Description: " + result.Description);
```

The output of the above code would be:

```
Name: Demo Item Description: This is a demo item
```

By using the SQLite.Net-PCL NuGet package, you can easily integrate SQLite with your Xamarin application.
