How do I use SQLite to perform a zigzag migration?
// plain

A zigzag migration is a type of database migration that involves creating a new database table, copying data from an existing table, and then deleting the existing table. It is often used when making changes to the structure of a database.

To perform a zigzag migration with SQLite, you can use the following code:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Create a new table with the new structure
CREATE TABLE new_table (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    column1 TEXT,
    column2 INTEGER
);

-- Copy data from the existing table
INSERT INTO new_table (id, column1, column2)
SELECT id, column1, column2
FROM old_table;

-- Delete the existing table
DROP TABLE old_table;

COMMIT;
```

The code above will create a new table with the desired structure, copy data from the existing table, and then delete the existing table.

Parts of the code:

- `BEGIN TRANSACTION;` - Starts a transaction, which ensures that all the steps in the migration are done in one atomic operation.
- `CREATE TABLE new_table (...)` - Creates a new table with the desired structure.
- `INSERT INTO new_table (...) SELECT ... FROM old_table;` - Copies data from the existing table to the new table.
- `DROP TABLE old_table;` - Deletes the existing table.
- `COMMIT;` - Commits the transaction, which will apply all the steps of the migration.
