# How can I use SQLite online?
// plain

SQLite is an open-source, self-contained, serverless SQL database engine that can be used to store and query data. It is one of the most popular databases, and is available for use online.

To use SQLite online, you can use an online SQLite editor, such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqliteonline.com/). This editor allows you to create, edit, and query an SQLite database, without needing to install the SQLite software on your computer.

For example, you can create a table using the following code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER
);
```

This code creates a table named `users`, with three columns - `id`, `name`, and `age`. The `id` column is the primary key, and `name` is a required field.

You can also use the editor to query the database. For example, you can retrieve all users in the database with the following code:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This code will return the following output:

```
id  name    age
1   John    21
2   Jane    22
3   Joe     23
```

Using an online SQLite editor is a great way to quickly create and query an SQLite database without needing to install any software.
