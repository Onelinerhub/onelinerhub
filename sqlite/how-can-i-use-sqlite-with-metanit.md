# How can I use SQLite with Metanit?
// plain

SQLite is a popular open source database that is commonly used with Metanit. It is a lightweight database that is easy to install and use. Here is an example of how to use SQLite with Metanit:

```
# Create a database connection
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("mydatabase.db")

# Create a table
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE users (name TEXT, age INTEGER)")

# Insert some data
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES ('John', 25)")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES ('Adam', 30)")

# Save changes
conn.commit()

# Retrieve data
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

# Print results
for row in cursor:
    print(row)

# Output:
# ('John', 25)
# ('Adam', 30)
```

In this example, we created a database connection to a SQLite database called "mydatabase.db". We then created a table called "users" with two columns: "name" and "age". We then inserted two records into the table. Finally, we retrieved the data and printed the results.
