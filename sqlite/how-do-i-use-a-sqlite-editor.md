# How do I use a SQLite editor?
// plain

SQLite is a lightweight, open-source, relational database management system (RDBMS) that is used to store and manipulate data. To use a SQLite editor, you first need to install the SQLite command-line tools. Once the tools are installed, you can create a database using the `sqlite3` command.

For example:
```
$ sqlite3 mydatabase.db
```

Once the database is created, you can use the SQLite editor to execute SQL statements and manage the database. To open the editor, type the command `sqlite3` followed by the name of the database file.

For example:
```
$ sqlite3 mydatabase.db
SQLite version 3.30.1 2019-10-10 20:19:45
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite>
```

Once the editor is open, you can use SQL commands to query and manipulate the database. For example, to create a table, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` command.

For example:
```
sqlite> CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

You can also use the editor to execute SQL queries. For example, to retrieve all the records from the `users` table, you can use the `SELECT` command.

For example:
```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM users;
```

These are just a few basic examples of how to use a SQLite editor. For more information, see the [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html).
