# How do I use the SQLite Entity Framework to create a database?
// plain

The SQLite Entity Framework is a powerful tool for creating databases. It allows developers to create and maintain databases using an object-oriented approach. To use the Entity Framework, you must first install the Entity Framework package.

Once the package is installed, you can create a database using the following code:

```
using (var db = new DatabaseContext())
{
    db.Database.EnsureCreated();
}
```
This code will create a database with the name specified in the DatabaseContext class.

You can then add tables to the database using Entity Framework's migrations. To create a migration, you can use the following code:

```
dotnet ef migrations add MyFirstMigration
```

This will create a migration class with the name MyFirstMigration. You can then add entities and properties to the migration class.

Once the migration is created, you can apply it to the database by running the following command:

```
dotnet ef database update
```

This will create the tables in the database, according to the entities and properties defined in the migration class.

You can also use Entity Framework to query the database. To do this, you must create a DbSet for each entity in the DatabaseContext class. You can then query the database using LINQ syntax.
