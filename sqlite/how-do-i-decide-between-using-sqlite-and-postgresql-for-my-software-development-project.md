# How do I decide between using SQLite and PostgreSQL for my software development project?
// plain

When deciding between SQLite and PostgreSQL for a software development project, the following considerations should be taken into account:

1. **Functionality**: SQLite is a serverless, transactional SQL database engine, while PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system. PostgreSQL provides more advanced features such as triggers, stored procedures, and views, which may be necessary for more complex projects.

2. **Scalability**: SQLite is suitable for small-scale applications, while PostgreSQL is better for large-scale applications.

3. **Performance**: SQLite is generally faster than PostgreSQL, but PostgreSQL can handle more concurrent connections.

4. **Data Security**: Both SQLite and PostgreSQL provide data security features such as encryption and authentication.

5. **Cost**: SQLite is open source and free, while PostgreSQL is more expensive.

6. **Example Code**:
```
// SQLite
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

c = conn.cursor()

c.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stocks (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)")

conn.commit()

conn.close()
```
