# What are some alternatives to using SQLite for software development?
// plain

1. **MySQL** is a popular alternative to SQLite that is widely used in software development. It is an open source relational database management system that is used to store data. MySQL is widely used in web applications and is compatible with many programming languages. Example code:

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

2. **PostgreSQL** is another open source relational database management system that is used as an alternative to SQLite. It is an object-relational database system that supports both SQL and NoSQL queries. PostgreSQL is popular for its robustness, scalability, and extensibility. Example code:

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL
);
```

3. **MongoDB** is a popular NoSQL database system that is often used as an alternative to SQLite. It is a document-oriented database system that is designed to store and query data in a JSON-like format. MongoDB is popular for its scalability and performance. Example code:

```
db.employees.insert({
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30
});
```

4. **Redis** is an open source, in-memory data structure store that is often used as an alternative to SQLite. It is a key-value store that is used to store and query data in a fast and efficient manner. Redis is popular for its speed and scalability. Example code:

```
SET employee:1 "John Doe"
HSET employee:1 age 30
```

These are just a few of the alternatives to SQLite that are available for software development. Each of these databases have their own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to consider your specific needs when selecting one.
