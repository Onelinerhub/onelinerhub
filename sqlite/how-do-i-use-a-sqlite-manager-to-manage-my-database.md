Using a SQLite Manager to manage your database is a straightforward process.

First, you need to install a SQLite Manager. There are several options available, such as [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt) and [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).

Once the SQLite Manager is installed, you can open the manager and create a new database. This can be done by clicking the "New Database" button, and selecting a name and location for the database.

You can then create tables in the database by clicking the "Execute SQL" tab and entering SQL commands. For example, to create a table called "employees" with three columns, you can use the following command:

```
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    salary INTEGER
);
```

You can also use the SQLite Manager to insert data into the database. To do this, you can use the "Execute SQL" tab and enter an INSERT statement. For example, to insert a row into the "employees" table, you can use the following command:

```
INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES ('John Smith', 50000);
```

Once the data is inserted, you can use the "Browse Data" tab to view the data in the table.

Finally, you can use the SQLite Manager to execute SQL queries on the database. This can be done by clicking the "Execute SQL" tab and entering a SELECT statement. For example, to select all the rows from the "employees" table, you can use the following command:

```
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

The output of this query would be a list of all the rows in the "employees" table.

Using a SQLite Manager is an easy way to manage your database.
