# How do I write a SQLite query example?
// plain

A SQLite query example can be written as follows:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
This query will select all columns and rows from the table named `table_name`.

Parts of the query:
- `SELECT`: This keyword is used to specify the columns to be returned by the query.
- `*`: This wildcard selector is used to select all columns from the table.
- `FROM`: This keyword is used to specify the table from which the data should be retrieved.
- `table_name`: This is the name of the table from which the data should be retrieved.
