# How can I use SQLite to query for records between two specific dates?
// plain

Using SQLite to query records between two specific dates is quite easy. Here is an example query:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE date_column BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-02-01';
```

This query will return all records from the table `table_name` where the value in the `date_column` is between the dates `2020-01-01` and `2020-02-01`.

The parts of this query are:
- `SELECT * FROM table_name`: This is the command to select all records from the table `table_name`.
- `WHERE date_column BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-02-01'`: This is the condition that will limit the records to those with a value in the `date_column` between the two dates.
