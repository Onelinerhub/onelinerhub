# How to use PHPMailer with PHP 7.4?
// plain

PHPMailer is a library for sending emails using PHP. It is compatible with PHP 7.4 and can be used to send emails from a website or application.

To use PHPMailer with PHP 7.4, first you need to download the latest version of PHPMailer from [Github](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer).

Once you have downloaded the library, you need to include it in your PHP script:
```php
require 'PHPMailer/src/PHPMailer.php';
```

Then, you need to create an instance of the PHPMailer class and set the necessary parameters for sending an email:
```php
$mail = new PHPMailer;
$mail->isSMTP();
$mail->Host = 'smtp.example.com';
$mail->SMTPAuth = true;
$mail->Username = 'username';
$mail->Password = 'password';
$mail->SMTPSecure = 'tls';
$mail->Port = 587;
```

Finally, you can add the recipient's address and the email content, and send the email:
```php
$mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Sender Name');
$mail->addAddress('to@example.com', 'Recipient Name');
$mail->Subject = 'Email Subject';
$mail->Body = 'This is the email body';
$mail->send();
```

The `$mail->send()` method will return `true` if the email was sent successfully, or `false` if there was an error.
