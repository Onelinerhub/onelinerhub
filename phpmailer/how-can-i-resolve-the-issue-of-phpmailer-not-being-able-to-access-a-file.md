The issue of PHPMailer not being able to access a file can be resolved by setting the correct permissions on the file. To do this, you can use the `chmod` command in the terminal.

For example, to set the permissions on a file called `test.txt` to `644`, you can use the following command:

```
$ chmod 644 test.txt
```

This will set the owner of the file to read and write, and the group and others to read only.

You can also use the `chown` command to set the owner of the file, if necessary. For example, to set the owner of `test.txt` to `user1`:

```
$ chown user1 test.txt
```

The following list explains the different permissions that can be set using the `chmod` command:

- `7` - Read, write, and execute
- `6` - Read and write
- `5` - Read and execute
- `4` - Read only
- `3` - Write and execute
- `2` - Write only
- `1` - Execute only
- `0` - No permission
