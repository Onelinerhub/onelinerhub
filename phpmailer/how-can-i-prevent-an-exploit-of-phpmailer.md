// plain

1. **Update PHPMailer**: Always make sure you are using the latest version of PHPMailer as security patches are regularly released to address any exploits.

2. **Validate Input**: Ensure that any user input is validated before being used in the PHPMailer script. It is important to whitelist the accepted inputs and reject any unexpected input.

```php
if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
    echo "Invalid email address";
}
```

3. **Enforce TLS**: To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, it is important to enforce the use of TLS encryption when sending emails. This can be done by setting the `SMTPSecure` property in the PHPMailer object.

```php
$mail->SMTPSecure = 'tls';
```

4. **Secure Auth Credentials**: It is important to ensure that any authentication credentials used to authenticate the PHPMailer script are stored securely. This can be done by using environment variables or a secure configuration file.

5. **Disable Remote Images**: By default, PHPMailer allows remote images to be included in emails. This can be a security risk as malicious images can be used to exploit the system. It is recommended to disable this feature.

```php
$mail->AllowEmbeddedImage = false;
```

6. **Disable Exe Attachments**: PHPMailer allows executable attachments to be sent. It is important to disable this feature as it can be used to exploit the system.

```php
$mail->AllowAttachmentTypes = 'zip,pdf,doc';
```

7. **Audit Logging**: It is important to keep track of any suspicious activity that may be related to an exploit. This can be done by enabling audit logging and monitoring the logs for any suspicious activity.
