# How can I use a try catch block with PHPMailer?
// plain

A try catch block can be used with PHPMailer to handle errors that may occur when sending an email. This will allow you to have a more precise control over the errors and how they are handled.

To use a try catch block with PHPMailer, you can use the following example code:

```php
try {
    // code to send email
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: ', $mail->ErrorInfo;
}
```

The code above will attempt to send an email, and if an error occurs, the error message will be displayed. The `$mail->ErrorInfo` variable contains the error message that will be displayed.

## Code explanation


- `try`: The try block contains the code that will be attempted, in this case sending an email.
- `catch`: The catch block contains the code that will be executed if an error occurs, in this case displaying the error message.
- `Exception`: The exception class is used to catch errors.
- `$e`: The `$e` variable is an instance of the `Exception` class, and it contains the error message.
- `$mail->ErrorInfo`: This variable contains the error message that will be displayed.
