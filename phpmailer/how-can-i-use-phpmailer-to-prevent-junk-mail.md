# How can I use PHPMailer to prevent junk mail?
// plain

PHPMailer is a popular library for sending emails, and it can be used to prevent junk mail.

To do this, PHPMailer offers a variety of features that can be used to reduce the chances of an email being marked as spam.

For example, PHPMailer has a built-in DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) feature that can be used to sign emails and verify their authenticity. This helps to ensure that the emails are coming from a legitimate source.

PHPMailer also provides an SPF (Sender Policy Framework) feature that can be used to verify that the sender of an email is authorized to send emails from a particular domain.

The library also offers support for SMTP authentication, which can be used to verify the identity of the sender before an email is sent.

Finally, PHPMailer offers a built-in anti-spam filter that can be used to detect suspicious content in emails.

Below is an example of how to use PHPMailer to prevent junk mail:

```php
require 'PHPMailer/PHPMailerAutoload.php';

$mail = new PHPMailer;

// Enable DKIM
$mail->DKIM_domain = 'example.com';
$mail->DKIM_private = '/path/to/private.key';
$mail->DKIM_selector = 'myselector';
$mail->DKIM_passphrase = '';
$mail->DKIM_identity = $mail->From;

// Enable SPF
$mail->Mailer = 'smtp';
$mail->Host = 'smtp.example.com';
$mail->SMTPAuth = true;
$mail->Username = 'user@example.com';
$mail->Password = 'password';
$mail->Port = 25;

// Enable SMTP authentication
$mail->SMTPAuth = true;
$mail->SMTPSecure = 'tls';

// Enable anti-spam filter
$mail->isHTML(true);
$mail->Body = '<h1>This is an example email</h1>';
$mail->Subject = 'Example Email';
$mail->AltBody = 'This is the plain text version of the email';

// Send the email
$mail->send();
```

This example code will enable DKIM, SPF, SMTP authentication, and the anti-spam filter in PHPMailer. This will help to ensure that emails sent with PHPMailer are not marked as spam.
