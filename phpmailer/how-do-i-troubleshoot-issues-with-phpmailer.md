# How do I troubleshoot issues with PHPMailer?
// plain

1. Check for errors in the code: Use the `errorInfo` property of the PHPMailer object to check for errors in the code.

2. Check the server configuration: Make sure that the `SMTP` settings are correct and the `smtp_port` is set correctly.

3. Check the mail server: Verify that the mail server is running and the `smtp_port` is open.

4. Check the mail log: Use the `mail.log` file to check for any errors or warnings that may be related to the issue.

5. Test the code: Use a simple test code to verify that the code is working correctly.

```
<?php
$mail = new PHPMailer();
$mail->addAddress('test@example.com');
$mail->Subject = 'Test';
$mail->Body = 'This is a test email';
if(!$mail->send()) {
    echo 'Error: ' . $mail->ErrorInfo;
} else {
    echo 'Message sent!';
}
?>
```

## Output example
 `Message sent!`

6. Check the mail headers: Use the `mail.headers` file to check the headers of the message to ensure that it is being sent correctly.

7. Check the documentation: Refer to the [PHPMailer documentation](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting) for more information about troubleshooting issues with PHPMailer.
