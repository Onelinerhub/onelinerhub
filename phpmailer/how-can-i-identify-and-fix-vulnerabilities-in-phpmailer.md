// plain

PHPMailer is a popular library for sending emails through PHP. It has several security vulnerabilities that can be identified and fixed.

1. **Verify Email Address Format:** It is important to ensure that the email address provided is in the correct format. This can be done by using the `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` function to validate the email address.

2. **Sanitize User Input:** User input should always be sanitized before being used in any operations. This can be done by using the `htmlspecialchars()` function or by using `strip_tags()` to remove any HTML tags.

3. **Validate Email Headers:** It is important to validate the email headers to ensure that they are in the correct format. This can be done by using `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` to validate the email address.

4. **Disable Remote Image Loading:** By default, PHPMailer allows remote images to be loaded in emails. This can be disabled by setting `$mail->SMTPOptions['allow_self_signed'] = false;` in the code.

5. **Disable External Links:** External links should always be disabled to prevent malicious links from being sent in emails. This can be done by setting `$mail->SMTPOptions['allow_self_signed'] = false;` in the code.

6. **Enforce TLS Encryption:** TLS encryption should always be enforced when sending emails. This can be done by setting `$mail->SMTPOptions['allow_self_signed'] = true;` in the code.

7. **Use PHPMailer Security Guide:** It is important to follow the [PHPMailer Security Guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Security) to ensure that all security vulnerabilities are identified and fixed.

```php
$mail->SMTPOptions['allow_self_signed'] = true;
```
