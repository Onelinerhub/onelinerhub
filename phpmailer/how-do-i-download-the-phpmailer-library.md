To download the PHPMailer library, you can use the Composer package manager.

You can also download the library manually from the [PHPMailer GitHub repository](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer).

The library consists of several parts:

* `class.phpmailer.php` – the main PHPMailer class
* `class.smtp.php` – the SMTP class
* `class.pop3.php` – the POP3 class
* `class.phpmaileroauth.php` – the OAuth 2.0 class
* `class.phpmaileroauthgoogle.php` – the Google OAuth 2.0 class
* `class.phpmailerlite.php` – the lightweight PHPMailer class
* `class.smtp.php` – the SMTP class

Each of these classes provides different functionality for sending emails.

You can find more information on using the PHPMailer library in the [official documentation](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki).
