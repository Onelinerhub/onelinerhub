# How do I ask a question about React.js?
// plain

To ask a question about React.js, you should first have a clear idea of the issue you are trying to solve. Once you have a good understanding of the problem, you can then research the available resources and documentation to see if there is a solution. If you are still unable to find a solution, you can then ask a question on a forum such as Stack Overflow, or post a question on the React.js Github page.

When asking a question, it is important to provide a concise description of the issue, and include any relevant code and/or error messages if applicable. For example:

```js
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The above code should render a "Hello World!" heading, however, nothing is being displayed.

It is also helpful to provide a link to a CodeSandbox or JSFiddle demonstrating the issue if possible. This allows others to quickly view the code and reproduce the issue.

In addition, it is important to be patient and polite when asking a question, as well as to thank anyone who takes the time to help you.
