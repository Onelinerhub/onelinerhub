# How can I use React.js and Tailwind to create a web application?
// plain

React.js and Tailwind can be used together to create a web application. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework, which allows developers to customize the look and feel of their web applications. React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

To use React.js and Tailwind together, you will need to include Tailwind's CSS file in your React application. You can do this by importing the Tailwind CSS file in your index.js file like this:

```javascript
import './tailwind.css'
```

Then, you can use Tailwind's utility classes in your React components. For example, you can use the `px-4` class to give your component a padding of 4px on all sides:

```javascript
<div className="px-4">My component</div>
```

You can also use Tailwind's color classes to style your components. For example, you can use the `text-gray-500` class to give your component text a gray color:

```javascript
<div className="text-gray-500">My component</div>
```

To learn more about how to use Tailwind with React, check out the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-with-react) and the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

In summary, React.js and Tailwind can be used together to create a web application. You can include Tailwind's CSS file in your React application and use Tailwind's utility classes to style your components.
