# How do I install Yarn for React.js?
// plain

Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that allows you to install and manage dependencies for your React projects.

To install Yarn for React.js, you will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After Node.js is installed, you can use the Node Package Manager (NPM) to install Yarn.

To install Yarn, open your terminal and type:
```
npm install -g yarn
```

This will install Yarn globally on your machine. To check that Yarn has been installed correctly, type:
```
yarn --version
```
The output should look something like this:
```
1.22.4
```

Once Yarn is installed, you can use it to install packages for your React project. For example, to install the React package, type:
```
yarn add react
```

Yarn will then install the React package and any of its dependencies. You can also use Yarn to update and delete packages, as well as check the version of the packages installed in your project.
