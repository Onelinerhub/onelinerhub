# How do I download React.js?
// plain

To download React.js, you can use npm, the Node Package Manager. Npm is a package manager for JavaScript and allows you to install, share and manage code packages.

### Example

First, you need to install Node.js on your computer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once Node.js is installed, you can open a terminal window and run the following command to install React.js:

```
npm install --save react react-dom
```

This will install both the React library and the React DOM library.

You can then use the `import` statement to import the React library into your code:

```js
import React from 'react';
```

The `import` statement allows you to use the React library in your code.

You can also use the `import` statement to import the React DOM library:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```

The React DOM library provides methods that allow you to interact with the DOM, such as rendering components and updating the DOM.

Once you have installed React.js, you can create React applications and use them in your projects.
