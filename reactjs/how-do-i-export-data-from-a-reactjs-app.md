# How do I export data from a ReactJS app?
// plain

Exporting data from a ReactJS app is a fairly straightforward process and there are several approaches you can take. One approach is to use the `fetch()` method to make an API call and retrieve the data from the server. The following example code shows how to use the `fetch()` method to make an API call and store the response data in a variable:

```javascript
fetch('http://example.com/api/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    let myData = data;
  });
```

If you are using the [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library, you can use the `get()` method to make an API call and store the response data in a variable:

```javascript
Axios.get('http://example.com/api/data')
  .then(response => {
    let myData = response.data;
  });
```

Once you have the data stored in a variable, you can use the [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) library to save the data to a file. The following example code shows how to save the data to a file in the JSON format:

```javascript
const file = new File([JSON.stringify(myData)], 'data.json', { type: 'application/json;charset=utf-8' });
saveAs(file);
```

This will create a file called `data.json` containing the data from the API call. You can also use the `FileSaver.js` library to export the data to other file formats such as CSV.
