# How can I use zxcvbn in a ReactJS project?
// plain

To use zxcvbn in a ReactJS project, first install the package with the command `npm install zxcvbn`.

Once the package is installed, it can be imported into the React project with the following code:

```
import zxcvbn from 'zxcvbn';
```

The zxcvbn library can then be used to check the strength of a password with the following code:

```
let password = 'password123';
let result = zxcvbn(password);

console.log(result.score); // Output: 0
```

The output of the above code is a `score` which is an integer between 0 and 4. 0 being the weakest and 4 being the strongest.

The `zxcvbn` function also returns an object with additional information about the password, such as the time it would take to crack the password and a list of words used in the password.

```
console.log(result.crack_times_seconds.online_no_throttling_10_per_second); // Output: 8.9
console.log(result.feedback.warning); // Output: 'This is a top-10 common password'
```

The zxcvbn library also provides a `matching` function which can be used to check for matches against a list of common passwords.

```
let matches = zxcvbn.matching('password123', ['password', '123456']);
console.log(matches); // Output: ['password']
```

The `matching` function returns an array of any matches found, which can then be used to check if the password is secure.
