How can I use ReactJS with W3Schools?
// plain

ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is one of the most popular libraries for creating web and mobile applications. W3Schools is a website that provides tutorials and references for web development technologies, including ReactJS.

You can use ReactJS with W3Schools by following the tutorials provided on their website. The tutorials are easy to follow and provide step-by-step instructions for building React applications.

For example, the following code block is from the W3Schools React tutorial:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

This code will render the text “Hello, world!” in the root element of the page.

## Code explanation


* `import React from 'react';` - This imports the React library, which provides the core functionality for React applications.
* `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';` - This imports the ReactDOM library, which provides the ability to render React components into the DOM.
* `ReactDOM.render()` - This is the function used to render React components into the DOM. It takes two arguments: the component to be rendered, and the DOM element to render it into.
* `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>` - This is the React component being rendered. It is a simple heading element containing the text “Hello, world!”.
* `document.getElementById('root')` - This is the DOM element that the component will be rendered into. It is the element with the ID of “root”.
