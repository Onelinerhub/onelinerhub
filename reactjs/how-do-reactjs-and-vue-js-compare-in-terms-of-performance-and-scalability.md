# How do ReactJS and Vue.js compare in terms of performance and scalability?
// plain

ReactJS and Vue.js are both popular JavaScript libraries used for creating user interfaces. Both libraries are fast and efficient, and they offer similar features for scalability.

When it comes to performance, ReactJS and Vue.js are both capable of rendering complex user interfaces quickly. ReactJS uses a virtual DOM to render components, which makes it faster than Vue.js, which uses a plain DOM.

In terms of scalability, both ReactJS and Vue.js offer features like component-based architecture, server-side rendering, and state management. ReactJS also has a wide range of third-party libraries that can be used to extend its functionality, such as Redux for state management and React Router for routing.

Here is an example of a ReactJS component:

```
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

And here is an example of a Vue.js component:

```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>My Component</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent'
}
</script>
```

Overall, ReactJS and Vue.js are both excellent libraries for creating user interfaces. They offer similar features for scalability and performance, and they both have a wide range of third-party libraries that can be used to extend their functionality.
