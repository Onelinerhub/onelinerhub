// plain

When deciding between ReactJS and React Native for a software development project, it is important to consider the needs of the project and the target platform. ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that can be used to create web applications. React Native is a mobile framework for building native mobile applications on Android and iOS.

For example, if the project requires building a web application, ReactJS is the ideal choice. If the project requires creating a native mobile application, then React Native is the best option.

Below is a simple example of ReactJS code that renders a basic web page.

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

The output of the example code is a web page that displays the text "Hello, world!".

React Native code is written in JavaScript and uses native components to render the UI. Below is an example of React Native code that displays a basic text message.

```
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

The output of the example code is a text message that displays the text "Hello, world!".

In conclusion, ReactJS and React Native are both excellent tools for software development, but they are best suited for different types of projects. For web applications, ReactJS is the best choice, and for native mobile applications, React Native is the ideal choice.
