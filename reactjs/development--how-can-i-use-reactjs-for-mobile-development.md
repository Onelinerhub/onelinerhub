How can I use ReactJS for mobile development?
// plain

ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It can be used for mobile development as well. Here is an example of how to create a basic React Native application:

```
import React from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, View } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

AppRegistry.registerComponent('MyApp', () => App);
```

The code above creates a basic React Native application that displays the text "Hello World!" on the screen. The code consists of the following components:

1. `import React from 'react'`: This statement imports the React library.

2. `import { AppRegistry, View } from 'react-native'`: This statement imports the AppRegistry and View components from the React Native library.

3. `const App = () => {...}`: This is a function that returns a view component.

4. `<View>...</View>`: This is the view component that displays the text.

5. `<Text>Hello World!</Text>`: This is the text component that displays the text "Hello World!"

6. `AppRegistry.registerComponent('MyApp', () => App);`: This statement registers the application with the AppRegistry.

With these components, you can create a basic React Native application that can be used for mobile development. For more information about React Native, please refer to the following links:
