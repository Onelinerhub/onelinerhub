# How can I use a ReactJS XML editor?
// plain

To use a ReactJS XML editor, you will need to install the ReactJS library. Once installed, you can create a React component to render the XML editor. The following example code will create a basic React component that renders an XML editor:

```
import React from "react";
import { XMLEditor } from "react-xml-editor";

class MyXMLEditor extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <XMLEditor
        value={this.props.xml}
        onChange={this.props.onChange}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

This code will create a React component called `MyXMLEditor` that renders an XML editor. The `value` and `onChange` props can be used to set the initial value and handle changes to the editor.

To use the editor, you can add it to your application like this:

```
<MyXMLEditor
  xml={someXmlString}
  onChange={handleChange}
/>
```

The `xml` prop should be set to the initial XML value, and the `onChange` prop should be set to a function that will be called when the value in the editor changes.

The React XML editor also supports additional features such as validation, formatting, and auto-completion. To find out more, you can check out the [React XML Editor documentation](https://github.com/vkbansal/react-xml-editor).
