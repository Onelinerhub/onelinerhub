// plain

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development. It can be used to develop applications with ReactJS, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

An IDE for ReactJS development typically includes features such as:

* Syntax highlighting and code completion for JavaScript and JSX
* Debugging tools
* Code refactoring
* Version control integration
* Build and deployment tools

The following is an example of a simple ReactJS component written in an IDE:

```
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This code will render the following output:

```
Hello World!
```

Popular IDEs for ReactJS development include Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, and Atom.
