# How can I use React.js with Java?
// plain

React.js can be used with Java to create interactive user interfaces. To use React.js with Java, the `react.js` library must first be imported. This can be done with the following code:

```
import React from 'react';
```

The React library can then be used to create components, which are reusable chunks of code that can be used to construct the user interface. For example, the following code creates a simple `HelloWorld` component:

```
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    );
  }
}
```

The component can then be rendered to the page by calling the `ReactDOM.render()` method, which takes two arguments: the component to render, and the DOM element in which to render it. For example:

```
ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This would render the `HelloWorld` component to the element with the ID `root`.

React.js components can also be used to pass data from the Java backend to the user interface. For example, the following code passes a `name` variable from Java to the `HelloWorld` component:

```
String name = "John";

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld name={name} />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

The `name` variable could then be accessed within the `HelloWorld` component with `this.props.name`.

React.js can be a powerful tool for creating interactive user interfaces with Java. For more information, see the [React.js documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
