# How can I create a React.js guide?
// plain

1. Start by creating a project structure for your React.js guide. This should include directories for components, views, and other relevant files.

2. Create a basic HTML page with a link to the React library, as well as any other libraries you may need.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>React Guide</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

3. Create components in the components directory. Components should include both a JavaScript file and a CSS file.

```js
import React from 'react';
import './MyComponent.css';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

4. Add the components to the views. This is where you will use the `ReactDOM.render()` method to render the components to the page.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent';

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

5. Create a build script to compile your React components into a single JavaScript file.

6. Add the compiled JavaScript file to your HTML page.

```html
<script src="path/to/compiled/js.js"></script>
```

7. Test your React.js guide by running it in your browser.
