// plain

To obtain a license for ReactJS, you must first understand the [React license](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#license). React is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE). This license grants users the permission to use, modify, and distribute the software for any purpose, as long as the copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

To use React, you must include the following code in your project:
```
import React from 'react';
```
This code imports the React library, which is necessary to use React.

You must also include the following code in your project:
```
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```
This code imports the ReactDOM library, which is necessary to render React components in the browser.

Finally, you must include the MIT License in your project. This license must be included in the project's root directory or any other directory which contains React code. The full text of the license can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE).

By including the React library, the ReactDOM library, and the MIT License, you will be able to use React in your project.
