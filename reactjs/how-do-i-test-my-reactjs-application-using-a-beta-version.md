# How do I test my ReactJS application using a beta version?
// plain

Testing a ReactJS application using a beta version is an important part of the development process. It helps to ensure the application is working correctly and will be ready for release.

To test a ReactJS application using a beta version, the following steps can be taken:

1. Create a beta version of the application. This can be done by creating a separate branch of the application and making any necessary changes to the code.

2. Run the application in a test environment. This can be done using a tool like Jest or Enzyme.

3. Test the application's functionality. This can be done by writing unit tests and integration tests.

4. Check the application's performance. This can be done by running performance tests and analyzing the results.

5. Debug any issues. This can be done by using a debugger like React DevTools to identify and fix any problems.

6. Deploy the application. This can be done by deploying the application to a staging environment and testing it in a real-world setting.

7. Monitor the application. This can be done by using tools like Sentry to track errors and performance issues.

## Example code


```
const test = () => {
  console.log('Running tests...');
};

test();
```

## Output example

```
Running tests...
