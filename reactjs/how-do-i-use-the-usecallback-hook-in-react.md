# How do I use the useCallback hook in React?
// plain

The `useCallback` hook in React is used to create a callback function that is memoized. This means that the callback will only be recreated when one of its dependencies has changed. This is useful for performance optimization, as it prevents unnecessary re-renders when a component is re-rendered.

An example of using `useCallback` looks like this:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count => count + 1);
  }, [setCount]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, `useCallback` is used to create a memoized version of the `increment` function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders when the component is re-rendered.

The code can be broken down as follows:

1. `const MyComponent = () => {` - This is the start of the component.
2. `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);` - This uses the `useState` hook to create a state variable called `count` with an initial value of `0`.
3. `const increment = useCallback(() => {` - This creates the `increment` function using the `useCallback` hook.
4. `setCount(count => count + 1);` - This is the body of the `increment` function, which updates the `count` state variable by one.
5. `}, [setCount]);` - This is the end of the `useCallback` hook, and it passes the `setCount` function as a dependency so that the `increment` function will be re-created when `setCount` changes.
6. `<button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>` - This is a button which calls the `increment` function when it is clicked.

For more information about the `useCallback` hook, see the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback).
