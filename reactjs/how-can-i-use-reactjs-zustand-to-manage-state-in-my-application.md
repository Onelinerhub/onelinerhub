# How can I use ReactJS Zustand to manage state in my application?
// plain

ReactJS Zustand is a lightweight, modern state-management library for React applications. It allows you to manage the state of your application with ease.

To use Zustand, you first need to create a store. This is where you will store all of your application's state.

```js
import create from 'zustand';

const [useStore] = create(set => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set(state => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
}));
```

Then, you can use the store in your components. To access the state, use the `useStore` hook provided by Zustand.

```js
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { count, increment } = useStore();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

When the `increment` button is clicked, the `count` will be incremented by one.
