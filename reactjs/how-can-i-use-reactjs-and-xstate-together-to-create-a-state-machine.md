# How can I use ReactJS and XState together to create a state machine?
// plain

ReactJS and XState can be used together to create a state machine. XState is a library for creating finite state machines and statecharts, and can be used to manage state in React applications.

To use ReactJS and XState together, you first need to install the XState library with `npm install xstate`.

Next, you need to create a machine with XState. The machine will define the states and transitions between them. For example:

```javascript
const machine = Machine({
  id: 'light',
  initial: 'green',
  states: {
    green: {
      on: {
        TIMER: 'yellow',
      },
    },
    yellow: {
      on: {
        TIMER: 'red',
      },
    },
    red: {
      on: {
        TIMER: 'green',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This machine defines a light with three states: green, yellow, and red. It also defines a transition from green to yellow when the TIMER event is sent.

Finally, you need to use the machine in a React component. This can be done by using the useMachine hook from XState. For example:

```javascript
const TrafficLight = () => {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Current State: {state.value}</div>
      <button onClick={() => send('TIMER')}>Timer</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This component will render the current state of the machine and a button to send the TIMER event.

ReactJS and XState can be used together to create a state machine. This allows developers to manage state in a React application in a more structured and predictable way.
