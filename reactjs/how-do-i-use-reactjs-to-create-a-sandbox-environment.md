# How do I use ReactJS to create a sandbox environment?
// plain

ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to create user interfaces. It can be used to create a sandbox environment by using the ReactDOM.render() method. This method accepts two arguments, the first being a React element, and the second being the DOM node where the React element should be rendered.

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

This example code will render the h1 element with the text “Hello, world!” within the DOM node with the id of “root”.

The ReactDOM.render() method is a great way to create a sandbox environment for testing React components. It allows you to quickly test components without having to create an entire React application.

The following list outlines the parts of the code example above:

1. `ReactDOM.render()` - This is the method used to render the React element within the DOM node.
2. `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>` - This is the React element that will be rendered.
3. `document.getElementById('root')` - This is the DOM node where the React element will be rendered.
