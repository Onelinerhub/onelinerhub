# How can I create and run tests in ReactJS?
// plain

Creating and running tests in ReactJS is a great way to ensure that your code is working as expected. Here is a basic example of how to create and run a test using the React Testing Library:

```
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';

test('My test', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<div>Hello world</div>);
  expect(getByText('Hello world')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

This code:
1. Imports the `React` library and the `render` and `fireEvent` functions from `@testing-library/react`.
2. Creates a test named 'My test' which will render a div with the text 'Hello world'.
3. Uses the `getByText` function to find the div with the text 'Hello world'.
4. Asserts that the div is in the document.

When the test is run, it will check that the div is in the document and output the result.
