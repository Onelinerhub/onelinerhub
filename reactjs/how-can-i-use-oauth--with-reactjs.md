# How can I use OAuth2 with ReactJS?
// plain

OAuth2 is an open authorization protocol that enables clients to access resources from a resource server with the authorization of the resource owner. It can be used with ReactJS to authenticate users and control access to protected resources.

## Example code

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { OAuth2 } from 'react-oauth2';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <OAuth2
        authorizationUrl="https://example.com/oauth2/authorize"
        clientId="exampleClientId"
        redirectUri="https://example.com/oauth2/redirect"
        scope="user_info"
      />
    );
  }
}
```

The code above will render an OAuth2 component that will allow users to authenticate and authorize access to the protected resources.

Parts of the code:
* `import React, { Component } from 'react'`: imports the React library and the Component class for creating React components.
* `import { OAuth2 } from 'react-oauth2'`: imports the OAuth2 component from the `react-oauth2` library.
* `authorizationUrl`: the URL of the authorization server.
* `clientId`: the identifier of the client application.
* `redirectUri`: the URL of the client application that the authorization server will redirect to after the authorization process.
* `scope`: the scope of the access requested by the client application.
