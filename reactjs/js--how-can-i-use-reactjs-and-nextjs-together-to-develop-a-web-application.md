How can I use ReactJS and NextJS together to develop a web application?
// plain

ReactJS and NextJS can be used together to develop a web application. NextJS is a framework that provides server-side rendering for React applications. This allows developers to create a single-page application with a full server-side rendering solution.

To use ReactJS and NextJS together, create a React component, then wrap it in a `<Link>` component from NextJS.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'next/link';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Link href="/my-page">
    <a>My Page</a>
  </Link>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

This will generate a link to the `/my-page` route. When the user clicks the link, the `/my-page` route will be rendered, and the React component will be displayed.

## Code explanation


* `import React from 'react'` - imports the React library
* `import { Link } from 'next/link'` - imports the `Link` component from NextJS
* `const MyComponent = () => (...)` - creates a React component
* `<Link href="/my-page">` - creates a link to the `/my-page` route
* `<a>My Page</a>` - the text that will be displayed in the link
* `export default MyComponent` - exports the React component
