# How can I use MetaNIT with ReactJS?
// plain

MetaNIT can be used with ReactJS to create a very powerful web application. To use MetaNIT with ReactJS, you need to install the MetaNIT package from npm. After installation, you can import MetaNIT into your React component with the following code:
```
import MetaNIT from 'metanit';
```

Once MetaNIT is imported, you can use it to create and configure your React components. For example, to create a simple React component with MetaNIT, you can use the following code:
```
const MyComponent = MetaNIT.create({
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
  }
});
```
This will create a React component that renders the text "Hello World!"

You can also use MetaNIT to create more complex components. For example, to create a React component that renders a list of items, you can use the following code:
```
const MyListComponent = MetaNIT.create({
  render() {
    const items = [
      {id: 1, name: 'Item 1'},
      {id: 2, name: 'Item 2'},
      {id: 3, name: 'Item 3'}
    ];

    return (
      <ul>
        {items.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  }
});
```
This will create a React component that renders a list of items.

Using MetaNIT with ReactJS allows you to create powerful components quickly and easily.
