XSS (Cross-site Scripting) attacks are a type of injection attack that inject malicious scripts into web pages. ReactJS provides several ways to prevent XSS attacks.

1. **Sanitize user input**: Sanitizing user input helps prevent malicious scripts from being injected into the page. For example, you can use the [`escape`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/escape) function to escape any special characters in the user input.

```javascript
const sanitizedInput = escape(userInput);
```

2. **Use a Content Security Policy**: A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security policy that helps prevent XSS attacks by restricting the sources of content that can be loaded on a web page. For example, you can use the [`Content-Security-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) header to specify which sources are allowed to be loaded on the page.

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

3. **Disable inline scripts**: Disabling inline scripts helps prevent malicious scripts from being injected into the page. For example, you can use the [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#dangerouslysetinnerhtml) prop to prevent React from rendering any inline scripts.

```javascript
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: sanitizedInput }} />
```

4. **Validate user input**: Validating user input helps prevent malicious scripts from being injected into the page. For example, you can use regular expressions to validate the user input and ensure that it does not contain any malicious scripts.

```javascript
const pattern = /<script>(.*?)<\/script>/g;
const isValid = !pattern.test(userInput);
```
