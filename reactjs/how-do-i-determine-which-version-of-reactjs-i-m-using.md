# How do I determine which version of ReactJS I'm using?
// plain

To determine which version of ReactJS you are using, you can use the `React.version` property.

## Example code

```
console.log(React.version);
```

## Output example

```
16.13.1
```

The `React.version` property is a string containing the version number of ReactJS. In the example above, the version number is `16.13.1`.

You can also check the version of ReactJS by looking in the `package.json` file of your project. The version number will be listed under the `dependencies` section.
