# How do I implement drag and drop in a ReactJS application?
// plain

Drag and drop can be implemented in ReactJS applications using the [React-dnd](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/overview) library. This library provides a set of components and hooks for implementing drag and drop in a React application.

## Example code

```
import React from 'react';
import { DndProvider } from 'react-dnd';
import HTML5Backend from 'react-dnd-html5-backend';

function App() {
  return (
    <DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>
      <div>
        ...
      </div>
    </DndProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The `DndProvider` component is used to wrap the application and provide access to the drag and drop functionality. The `backend` prop is used to specify the backend implementation. In this case, we are using the HTML5 backend.

The application can then use the `useDrag` and `useDrop` hooks to access the drag and drop functionality. For example, the following code uses the `useDrag` hook to create a draggable component:

```
import React from 'react';
import { useDrag } from 'react-dnd';

function DraggableComponent() {
  const [{ isDragging }, drag] = useDrag({
    item: { type: 'component' },
    collect: monitor => ({
      isDragging: monitor.isDragging()
    })
  });

  return (
    <div ref={drag}>
      ...
    </div>
  );
}

export default DraggableComponent;
```

The `useDrag` hook takes an object with an `item` property and a `collect` function. The `item` property is used to specify the type of item that is being dragged. The `collect` function is used to collect information about the drag operation, such as whether the item is currently being dragged.

The `drag` function returned by the `useDrag` hook is then used to set the `ref` of the draggable element. This allows the drag and drop system to track the element and handle the drag operation.
