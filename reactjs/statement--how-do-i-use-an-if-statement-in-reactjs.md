How do I use an if statement in ReactJS?
// plain

An if statement is a control flow statement that allows a program to execute a certain code block based on a given condition. In ReactJS, if statements can be used to conditionally render components or elements depending on the value of a given expression.

For example, the following code block uses an if statement to conditionally render a <h1> element if the value of the variable isTrue is true:

```js
let isTrue = true;

if (isTrue) {
  return <h1>This is rendered!</h1>;
}
```

The output of this code would be:

```
This is rendered!
```

The code block consists of the following parts:
1. The `let isTrue = true` line declares a variable and assigns it the value of true.
2. The `if (isTrue)` line is the if statement, which evaluates the expression `isTrue` and will execute the code block if the expression is true.
3. The code block `{ return <h1>This is rendered!</h1>; }` consists of the code that will be executed if the expression in the if statement is true.
