# What is React.js and how is it used in software development?
// plain

React.js is an open source JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces. It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile applications. React.js is used to create reusable UI components that can be used in different parts of an application.

React.js provides a declarative way of writing components. It uses a virtual DOM to render components and update the view when the data changes. This makes React.js applications very fast and efficient.

## Example code

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Output example


Hello, World!

## Code explanation

- `import React from 'react'` - imports the React library
- `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'` - imports the ReactDOM library
- `class App extends React.Component {` - defines the App component as a subclass of React.Component
- `render() {` - defines the render method which returns the JSX to render
- `return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>` - returns the JSX to render
- `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))` - renders the App component into the element with the id of 'root'
