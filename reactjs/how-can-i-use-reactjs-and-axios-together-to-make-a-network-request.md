# How can I use ReactJS and Axios together to make a network request?
// plain

ReactJS and Axios can be used together to make a network request. Axios is a popular library used to make network requests from the browser. It works with React by providing an easy-to-use syntax for making requests.

Here is an example of a GET request using React and Axios:

```
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('http://example.com/data')
      .then(res => setData(res.data))
      .catch(err => console.log(err))
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      {JSON.stringify(data)}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

This code will make a GET request to the URL `http://example.com/data` and store the response data in the `data` state variable. The response data will then be displayed in the view.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';` - imports the React library and the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks.
2. `import axios from 'axios';` - imports the Axios library.
3. `const [data, setData] = useState({});` - creates a state variable called `data` and a function to set the value of `data`.
4. `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])` - a hook which runs the code inside the function when the component is mounted.
5. `axios.get('http://example.com/data')` - makes a GET request to the URL `http://example.com/data`.
6. `.then(res => setData(res.data))` - sets the response data to the `data` state variable.
7. `.catch(err => console.log(err))` - logs any errors to the console.
8. `{JSON.stringify(data)}` - displays the response data in the view.
