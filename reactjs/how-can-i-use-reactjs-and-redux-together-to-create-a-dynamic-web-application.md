# How can I use ReactJS and Redux together to create a dynamic web application?
// plain

ReactJS and Redux can be used together to create a dynamic web application by leveraging the features of both libraries. ReactJS is a library for creating user interfaces, while Redux is a library for managing application state.

By combining these two libraries, an application can be created that is both dynamic and user-friendly. For example, the following code creates a simple React component that uses Redux to store and update a counter:

```
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const Counter = ({ counter, increment, decrement }) => (
  <div>
    <h2>Counter</h2>
    <div>{counter}</div>
    <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
  </div>
);

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  counter: state.counter,
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }),
  decrement: () => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' }),
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

This code creates a React component that is connected to a Redux store, and is able to update the store's state. The component renders a counter, and has two buttons for incrementing and decrementing the counter.

The following code creates an initial Redux store, and provides the store to the React component:

```
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import Counter from './Counter';

const initialState = { counter: 0 };

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { counter: state.counter + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { counter: state.counter - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = createStore(reducer);

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Counter />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

This code creates a Redux store with an initial state of `{ counter: 0 }`, and provides the store to the React component. When the buttons are clicked, the store's state is updated accordingly.

By combining ReactJS and Redux, a dynamic web application can be created that is both user-friendly and easy to maintain.

## Code explanation
**

1. `<Counter />`: This is the React component that renders the counter and buttons.
2. `mapStateToProps`: This function maps the Redux store's state to the React component's props.
3. `mapDispatchToProps`: This function maps the Redux store's dispatch function to the React component's props.
4. `reducer`: This function is used to update the Redux store's state when an action is dispatched.
5. `createStore`: This function creates a Redux store with the given reducer and initial state.
6. `<Provider />`: This component is used to provide the Redux store to the React component.
