# How do I use React.js components in my project?
// plain

To use React.js components in your project, you will first need to install the React library. You can do this using npm by running the command `npm install react`.

After installing React, you can create a component by using the `React.createElement` function. This function takes three arguments: the type of element you want to create, an object containing any props you want to pass to the component, and any children you want to render inside the component. For example, the following code will create a simple `<h1>` element with the text `Hello, world!`:

```js
const element = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello, world!');
```

Once you have created the component, you can render it to the page by using the `ReactDOM.render` function. This function takes two arguments: the component you want to render, and the DOM node you want to render the component to. For example, the following code will render the `element` component to the `#root` node:

```js
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

When the component is rendered, it will produce the following output:

```
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

You can also create React components using JavaScript classes. To do this, you will need to create a class that extends the `React.Component` class and implement the `render` method. This method should return the component you want to render. For example, the following code will create a component that renders a `<h1>` element with the text `Hello, world!`:

```js
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello, world!');
  }
}
```

Once you have created the component, you can render it to the page by using the `ReactDOM.render` function as before.

For more information on using React components, see the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
