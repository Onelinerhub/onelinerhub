# How do I use a ReactJS builder to create a web application?
// plain

Creating a web application with ReactJS is an easy and efficient way to create a dynamic user interface. To use a ReactJS builder to create a web application, you will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

First, create a new project with the ReactJS builder. This will create a new directory with the necessary files and structure.

```
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

Next, open the project directory in a code editor of your choice. You will find the `index.html` file in the `public` directory, which is the main entry point of the application. This file will include the `<div>` element with the `id` of `root`. This is where the React application will be rendered.

Next, open the `index.js` file in the `src` directory. This is where the React components will be defined. To create a React component, use the `React.createClass()` method.

```
const MyComponent = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    );
  }
});
```

The React component can then be rendered to the DOM using the `ReactDOM.render()` method.

```
ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Once the React component is rendered to the DOM, you can add additional features such as state, props, and lifecycle methods.
