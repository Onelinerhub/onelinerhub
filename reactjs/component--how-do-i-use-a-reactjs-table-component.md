How do I use a ReactJS table component?
// plain

To use a ReactJS table component, you need to first install the library containing the component. For example, you can install the `react-table` library with the following command: `npm install react-table`.

Once the library is installed, you can then import the table component into your ReactJS application. Here is an example of the code you would use to do this:

```js
import ReactTable from 'react-table';
```

After that, you can create a table component in your application by using the `ReactTable` object. The following example code shows how to create a basic table component with two columns and two rows:

```js
<ReactTable
    data={[
        {
            name: 'John',
            age: 25
        },
        {
            name: 'Jane',
            age: 30
        }
    ]}
    columns={[
        {
            Header: 'Name',
            accessor: 'name'
        },
        {
            Header: 'Age',
            accessor: 'age'
        }
    ]}
/>
```

This code will create a table with two columns labeled `Name` and `Age` and two rows containing the data `John` and `25` and `Jane` and `30`, respectively.

You can also customize the table component with various properties. For example, you can add a `style` property to the `ReactTable` object to specify the styling of the table.

Additionally, you can use the various lifecycle methods of the `ReactTable` object to customize the table even further.
