# How do React.js and Vue differ in terms of usage and performance?
// plain

React.js and Vue are two popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. They both provide a component-based approach to building UIs, but there are some key differences in terms of usage and performance.

React.js is a library created by Facebook and is used for building large-scale applications. It uses a Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to render components, which helps to optimize performance. It is also more opinionated than Vue, meaning that developers must follow certain conventions when writing code.

Vue, on the other hand, is more lightweight than React and is often used for smaller projects. It uses a reactive and composable view model to render components, which allows for more flexibility when writing code. Vue also has a much smaller learning curve than React, making it easier to learn and use.

## Example code

```
// React
import React from 'react';
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
  }
}

// Vue
import Vue from 'vue';
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  template: '<div>Hello World</div>'
})
```

Output of example code:
```
Hello World
```

## Code explanation


1. `import React from 'react';`: This imports the React library into the application.

2. `class App extends React.Component {`: This creates a new React component called App.

3. `render() {`: This is a method that is used to render the component.

4. `return <div>Hello World</div>;`: This returns a React element containing the text "Hello World".

5. `import Vue from 'vue';`: This imports the Vue library into the application.

6. `new Vue({`: This creates a new Vue instance.

7. `el: '#app'`: This tells the Vue instance which element to mount to.

8. `template: '<div>Hello World</div>'`: This is the template that will be rendered by the Vue instance.

In conclusion, React and Vue differ in terms of usage and performance. React is more opinionated and is used for large-scale applications, while Vue is more lightweight and is used for smaller projects.
