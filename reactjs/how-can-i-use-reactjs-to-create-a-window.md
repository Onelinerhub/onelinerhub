# How can I use ReactJS to create a window?
// plain

ReactJS can be used to create a window by using the `create-react-app` command. This command creates a new React application with all the necessary files and dependencies. To create a window, you need to add the following code to the `index.js` file in the src folder:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

const App = () => {
  return <div>My Window</div>;
};

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This code will create a window with the text "My Window".

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import React from 'react'`: This statement imports the React library.
2. `import { render } from 'react-dom'`: This statement imports the `render` method from the `react-dom` library.
3. `const App = () => { return <div>My Window</div>; }`: This statement creates a component called `App` which returns a `<div>` element with the text "My Window".
4. `render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))`: This statement renders the `App` component into the `root` element in the HTML.
