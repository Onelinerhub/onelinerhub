# How can I use ReactJS to develop a web application?
// plain

ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create reusable UI components for web applications. It is used to create single-page applications that can be used to build dynamic user interfaces.

To use ReactJS to develop a web application, you will need to create a React application using the `create-react-app` command. This will create a project structure with all the necessary files and dependencies.

Once the project is created, you can start creating components and adding them to the application. Components can be created using JavaScript or JSX, which is a syntax extension of JavaScript.

## Example code

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

The components created can then be used to create the application's UI. Components can be nested inside one another to create complex user interfaces.

React also provides a set of tools to help with the development of the application, such as the React Developer Tools for Chrome and the React Native tools for mobile applications.

Finally, the application can be deployed to a web server or hosted on a cloud platform such as Heroku or Netlify.

## Code explanation


- `import React from 'react';` - This line imports the React library, which is required for all React components.
- `class MyComponent extends React.Component {` - This line creates a new React component class.
- `render() {` - This method is used to render the component's UI.
- `export default MyComponent;` - This line exports the component so it can be used in other parts of the application.
