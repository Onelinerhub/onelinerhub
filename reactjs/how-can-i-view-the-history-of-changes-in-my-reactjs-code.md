# How can I view the history of changes in my ReactJS code?
// plain

Viewing the history of changes in ReactJS code can be done using the `git log` command. This command will show the history of changes in the code, including who made the change, when the change was made, and what the change was.

For example, running the following command:

```
git log
```

Will output something like this:

```
commit 8a4b3f7c17d1e7f9a9a7c9b3b5a1f6f8e82e2d88
Author: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
Date:   Sat May 9 14:32:48 2020 -0400

    Fix bug in React component

commit c7d1e7f9a9a7c9b3b5a1f6f8e82e2d88c8a4b3f7
Author: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
Date:   Sat May 9 14:15:48 2020 -0400

    Add new React component
```

This output shows that the most recent change was to fix a bug in a React component, and the previous change was to add a new React component.

In addition to `git log`, there are other tools available to view the history of changes in ReactJS code, such as [git-history](https://github.com/pomber/git-history) and [git-blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame).

These tools can provide even more detailed information about the changes that have been made to the code, such as which lines of code were modified, when they were modified, and who modified them.
