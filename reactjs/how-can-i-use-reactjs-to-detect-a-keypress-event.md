# How can I use ReactJS to detect a keypress event?
// plain

ReactJS provides a way to detect keypress events through the use of the `onKeyPress` event handler. This event handler can be attached to a React component and will fire whenever a key is pressed while the component is in focus. The event handler will be passed an event object containing information about the key that was pressed.

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  handleKeyPress(event) {
    console.log(`A key was pressed: ${event.key}`);
  }

  render() {
    return <div onKeyPress={this.handleKeyPress} />;
  }
}
```

When the above component is in focus and a key is pressed, the following output will be logged to the console:

```
A key was pressed: <key pressed>
```

The following parts are involved in the code above:

1. The `handleKeyPress` method is the event handler that will be called whenever a key is pressed while the component is in focus. It takes an event object as an argument, which contains information about the key that was pressed.

2. The `onKeyPress` event handler is attached to the component's `render` method. This allows the event handler to be called whenever a key is pressed while the component is in focus.

3. The `event.key` property is used to log the key that was pressed to the console.
