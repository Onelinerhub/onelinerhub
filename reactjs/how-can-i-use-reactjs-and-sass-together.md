# How can I use ReactJS and SASS together?
// plain

ReactJS and SASS can be used together to create dynamic, responsive webpages and applications.

SASS is a CSS preprocessor that allows for the use of variables, mixins, functions, and more. It can be used to create complex, nested stylesheets, making code easier to read and maintain.

ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create reusable components that can be used to create dynamic, interactive webpages.

To use ReactJS and SASS together, you must first compile the SASS code into CSS code. This can be done with a SASS compiler such as [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass). Once the SASS code has been compiled, it can then be imported into the ReactJS component.

For example, the following code will import a SASS file named `style.scss` into a ReactJS component:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './style.scss';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

The `style.scss` file can then be used to style the `MyComponent` component:
```scss
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

The resulting output will be a red `<h1>` with a font size of 24px.

ReactJS and SASS can be used together to create powerful, dynamic webpages and applications. By taking advantage of SASS's features, such as variables, mixins, and functions, developers can create complex stylesheets that are easier to read and maintain.
