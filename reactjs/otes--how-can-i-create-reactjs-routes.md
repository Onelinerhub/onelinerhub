How can I create ReactJS routes?
// plain

Creating routes in ReactJS is relatively easy. You will need to install React Router and use the `<Route>` component. To create a route, you will need to specify a `path` and a `component` that will be rendered when the path is matched.

For example, if you wanted to create a route for the Home page, you could use the following code:

```js
<Route path="/" component={Home} />
```

This will render the `Home` component when the `/` path is matched. You can also pass props to the component using the `render` prop.

```js
<Route path="/" render={() => <Home user="John" />} />
```

This will pass the `user` prop with the value of `John` to the `Home` component.

You can also use the `Switch` component to render multiple routes at the same time. For example:

```js
<Switch>
  <Route path="/" component={Home} />
  <Route path="/about" component={About} />
  <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
</Switch>
```

This will render the `Home`, `About` and `Contact` components when the respective paths are matched.

React Router also provides a `<Link>` component which can be used to create links between routes.

```js
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link to the `/about` route.
