How do I develop a React.js app?
// plain

To develop a React.js app, you must first set up a development environment. This involves installing Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, and setting up a package manager such as npm or yarn.

Once the environment is set up, you can create a new React app using the `create-react-app` command. This will generate a directory structure and all the necessary files for a React app.

```
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

The following files and directories will be created:

* `package.json` - This file stores all the information about the project, such as the dependencies and scripts.
* `node_modules` - This directory stores all the dependencies installed by npm or yarn.
* `public` - This directory contains the HTML file that is used to render the React app.
* `src` - This directory contains all the source code for the React app.

Once the project is set up, you can start writing code in the `src` directory. The entry point for the React app is the `index.js` file. This is where you can render the React components and start the app.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Finally, you can run the app using the `npm start` command. This will start a development server and open the app in the browser.

For more information, see the React documentation:
