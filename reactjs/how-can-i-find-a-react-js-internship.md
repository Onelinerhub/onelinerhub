        <h1>Hello React!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

React.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**Output:**

Hello React!

## Code explanation
**

- `const React = require('react');`: This line imports the React library.
- `class App extends React.Component { ... }`: This creates a class component called App.
- `render() { ... }`: This is the render method, which returns the JSX that will be rendered to the DOM.
- `<div> ... </div>`: This is a JSX element which wraps the `<h1>` element.
- `<h1>Hello React!</h1>`: This is a JSX element which displays the text "Hello React!".
- `React.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));`: This renders the App component to the DOM.
