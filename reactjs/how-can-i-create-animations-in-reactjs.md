# How can I create animations in ReactJS?
// plain

Creating animations in ReactJS is a fairly straightforward process. To begin, you'll need to import the `react-transition-group` library. This library provides the components needed to create animations in React.

For example, you can use the `CSSTransition` component to create a simple fade animation:

```js
import { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';

const Fade = () => (
  <CSSTransition
    in={true} // This prop will trigger the animation
    timeout={1000} // This prop defines how long the animation should last
    classNames="fade" // This prop defines the className to be used for the animation
  >
    <div>Fade</div>
  </CSSTransition>
);
```

The `in` prop is used to trigger the animation, `timeout` defines how long the animation should last, and `classNames` defines the className to be used for the animation. The animation will transition the `div` element from `fade-enter` to `fade-enter-active` to `fade-enter-done`.

In addition to `CSSTransition`, you can also use the `Transition` component to create more complex animations. This component provides more control over the animation lifecycle, allowing you to define custom enter and exit transitions.
