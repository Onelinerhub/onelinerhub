# How do I use React JS with W3Schools?
// plain

React JS is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It can be used with W3Schools to create interactive webpages and components. Here is an example of how to use React JS with W3Schools:

```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

This code will render a `<h1>` tag with the text "Hello World!" on the page.

The code is broken down into the following parts:

1. `import React from "react"`: This imports the React library.
2. `import ReactDOM from "react-dom"`: This imports the ReactDOM library which is used to interact with the DOM.
3. `const App = () => { ... }`: This is a React component which returns the `<h1>` tag.
4. `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))`: This renders the React component onto the page.
