# How can I use ReactJS Suspense to improve my app's loading performance?
// plain

ReactJS Suspense can be used to improve loading performance in an app by allowing components to suspend rendering while they wait for something, such as data from an API call, to load. This can be done by wrapping a component in a `<Suspense>` component and providing a `fallback` prop, which is the component that will be rendered while the component is waiting for the data.

For example, the following code will render a `<Spinner>` component while the `<UserData>` component waits for the data to load:

```js
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <UserData />
</Suspense>
```

The `<Suspense>` component accepts a `maxDuration` prop that can be used to specify the maximum amount of time the `<Spinner>` component should be displayed before displaying an error.

```js
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />} maxDuration={1000}>
  <UserData />
</Suspense>
```

Additionally, the `<Suspense>` component can be used to lazy-load components by using the `React.lazy()` function. This allows components to be loaded only when they are needed.

```js
const UserData = React.lazy(() => import('./UserData'));

// ...

<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <UserData />
</Suspense>
```

ReactJS Suspense can be used to improve loading performance in an app by suspending rendering while components wait for data to load, lazy-loading components, and setting a maximum duration for the loading process.
