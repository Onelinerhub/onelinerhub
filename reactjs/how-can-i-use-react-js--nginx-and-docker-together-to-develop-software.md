# How can I use React.js, Nginx and Docker together to develop software?
// plain

React.js, Nginx, and Docker can be used together to develop software by creating a Docker container to host the application. This container can be configured to use Nginx as a web server and React.js as the front-end framework.

The following example code block will create a Docker container with Nginx and React.js:

```
# Create a new Docker container
docker run -p 80:80 -d --name my-app nginx

# Install React.js
docker exec -it my-app npm install react react-dom

# Set up Nginx
docker exec -it my-app nginx -c /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

## Code explanation

1. Create a new Docker container - this will create a new Docker container with the name "my-app" and will use Nginx as the web server.
2. Install React.js - this will install the React.js framework into the Docker container.
3. Set up Nginx - this will configure Nginx to use the React.js framework.

Once the Docker container is set up, the application can be developed using React.js and deployed using Docker.
