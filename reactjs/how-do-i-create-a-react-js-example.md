# How do I create a React.js example?
// plain

Creating a React.js example is relatively easy. First, create a directory for your project and navigate to that directory in the terminal. Then, run the following command to initialize a new React project with create-react-app:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

This will create a directory called `my-app` with the necessary files and dependencies to get started.

Next, open the `my-app` directory in your favorite code editor. Inside of the `src` directory, open the `App.js` file. This is the main file where you will write your React code.

You can start by replacing the existing code with the following example code:

```
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello React!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This code will render the text "Hello React!" on the page.

Finally, run the following command to start the development server:

```
npm start
```

This will open a new browser window and display the example React code you wrote.
