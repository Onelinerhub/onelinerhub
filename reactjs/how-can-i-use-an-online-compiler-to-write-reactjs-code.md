You can use an online compiler to write ReactJS code by using the free open source compiler [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). It provides a full development environment for web applications such as React, Vue, and Angular, with built-in support for Node.js, Babel, and TypeScript.

For example, here is a simple React component written in CodeSandbox:

```jsx
import React from "react";

function App() {
  return <div>Hello World!</div>;
}

export default App;
```

This code will output the following:

```
Hello World!
```

The code is composed of the following parts:

1. `import React from "react"` - imports the React library from the "react" package.
2. `function App()` - defines a function called App.
3. `return <div>Hello World!</div>` - returns a React element with the text "Hello World!".
4. `export default App` - exports the App function so it can be used in other files.

CodeSandbox also provides several helpful features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools. Additionally, you can use it to create and share your projects with others.
