ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used for creating interactive single-page applications and can be used with a variety of technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a beginner, the best way to get started with ReactJS is to learn the basics of JavaScript and HTML.

Once you have a basic understanding of these two languages, you can start exploring ReactJS. A good place to start is the ReactJS documentation, which provides an overview of the library and its features.

To get a better understanding of how ReactJS works, you can also try out some example code. Here is a simple example of a React component:

```
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
  }
}
```

This code creates a React component called `MyComponent` that displays the text "Hello, world!" when rendered.

To get started with ReactJS, you should also familiarize yourself with the following concepts:

* Components and props
* State and lifecycle
* Rendering
* Events
* Forms
* Refs

You can learn more about these concepts in the ReactJS documentation. Additionally, there are many tutorials and resources available online to help you get started.
