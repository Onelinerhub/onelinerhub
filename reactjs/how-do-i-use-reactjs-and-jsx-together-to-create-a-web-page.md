# How do I use ReactJS and JSX together to create a web page?
// plain

ReactJS and JSX are both JavaScript libraries used to create interactive user interfaces. ReactJS is a library for building user interfaces, while JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that makes it easier to write React components. Together, they can be used to create a web page.

For example, here is a React component written in JSX:

```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is my component</h1>
      <p>This is some content.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This component can be imported into another React component and rendered on the page.

```
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The output of this code would be:

```
<div>
  <h1>This is my component</h1>
  <p>This is some content.</p>
</div>
```

In summary, ReactJS and JSX can be used together to create a web page by creating React components written in JSX and then importing and rendering them in other components.
