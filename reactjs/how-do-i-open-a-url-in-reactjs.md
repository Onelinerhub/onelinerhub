# How do I open a URL in ReactJS?
// plain

To open a URL in ReactJS, you can use the [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) method. This method takes two parameters: a URL string and a window name.

The following example code opens the URL `https://www.example.com` in a new window named `exampleWindow`:

```js
window.open('https://www.example.com', 'exampleWindow');
```

No output is produced.

The code consists of two parts:

1. The `window.open()` method, which is used to open a new window for a specified URL.
2. The parameters of the `window.open()` method, which are the URL and the window name.

For more information on the `window.open()` method, see the [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open).
