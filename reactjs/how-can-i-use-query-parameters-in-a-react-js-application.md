# How can I use query parameters in a React.js application?
// plain

Query parameters are a way to pass additional information to a React.js application. They can be used to provide dynamic data to the application, such as user preferences or an API key.

Here is an example of how to use query parameters in a React.js application:

```
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  const location = useLocation();
  const queryParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
  const apiKey = queryParams.get('apiKey');

  // use apiKey to access an API
  ...
}
```

In this example, the `useLocation` hook is used to get the current URL, and then `URLSearchParams` is used to parse the query parameters from the URL. The `get` method is then used to access the `apiKey` parameter from the query string. The `apiKey` can then be used to access an API.

## Code explanation


- `useLocation`: This is a React Router hook that is used to get the current URL.
- `URLSearchParams`: This is a built-in JavaScript class that is used to parse the query parameters from a URL.
- `get`: This is a method on the `URLSearchParams` class that is used to access the value of a query parameter.
