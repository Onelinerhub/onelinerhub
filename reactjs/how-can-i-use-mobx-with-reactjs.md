# How can I use MobX with ReactJS?
// plain

MobX is a state management library that can be used with ReactJS to help manage state in a more efficient and organized manner. It provides better performance and more flexibility than traditional methods of state management.

To use MobX with ReactJS, it is necessary to install the `mobx` and `mobx-react` packages.

```
npm install mobx mobx-react
```

Then, you can create a store using the `observable` and `action` decorators from MobX. The store can be used to store the state of the application.

```js
import { observable, action } from "mobx";

class Store {
  @observable value = 0;

  @action
  increment() {
    this.value++;
  }
}

const store = new Store();
```

Finally, you can use the `Provider` component from `mobx-react` to wrap your application and provide the store to the components.

```js
import { Provider } from "mobx-react";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

The components can then access the store using the `inject` decorator.

```js
import { inject } from "mobx-react";

@inject("store")
class Component extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { store } = this.props;
    return <div>{store.value}</div>;
  }
}
```
