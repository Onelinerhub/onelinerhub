# How do I set the z-index of a ReactJS component?
// plain

In ReactJS, the z-index of an element can be set using the style property. This property allows you to set the z-index of a component relative to other components on the page.

For example, the following code sets the z-index of a React component to 5:

```
<MyComponent style={{ zIndex: 5 }} />
```

The z-index property can be used to set the stacking order of elements on the page. The higher the z-index value, the higher the element will be in the stacking order.

## Code explanation


- `style`: This is a React property that allows you to set the style of a component.
- `zIndex`: This is the property that is used to set the z-index of a component. The higher the value, the higher the element will be in the stacking order.
