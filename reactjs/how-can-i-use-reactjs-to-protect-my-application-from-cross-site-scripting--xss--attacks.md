# How can I use ReactJS to protect my application from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks?
// plain

ReactJS provides built-in protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by escaping user input. This means that any user input is converted from a string into HTML entities, which prevents malicious code from being executed.

For example, if a user inputs a string such as `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, ReactJS will convert it to `&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;`, which will not be executed.

Additionally, ReactJS provides a library called `react-escape-html`, which can be used to provide additional protection against XSS attacks. The library can be used as follows:

```javascript
import escapeHtml from 'react-escape-html';

const userInput = '<script>alert('XSS')</script>';
const escapedInput = escapeHtml(userInput);
console.log(escapedInput); // &lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;
```

The library also provides a `escapeAttributes` function, which can be used to escape user input in HTML attributes. For example:

```javascript
import { escapeAttributes } from 'react-escape-html';

const userInput = '" onclick="alert('XSS')';
const escapedInput = escapeAttributes(userInput);
console.log(escapedInput); // &quot; onclick=&quot;alert('XSS')&quot;
```

By using ReactJS and the `react-escape-html` library, developers can protect their applications from XSS attacks.
