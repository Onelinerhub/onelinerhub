// plain

Deploying a React.js application to Netlify is easy and straightforward.

1. First, you need to create a new project using the create-react-app command:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

2. Next, you need to install the Netlify CLI to deploy your application:

```
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

3. Now you can log into your Netlify account and create a new site:

```
netlify login
netlify init
```

4. Once you have created a new site, you can deploy your application using the following command:

```
netlify deploy --prod
```

5. After the deployment is complete, you will be given a URL where you can access your application.

6. You can also configure your application to automatically deploy when changes are made to your code by setting up a webhook in your Netlify account.

7. Finally, you can view the logs of your deployments in your Netlify account.

For more information, please refer to the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#deploy-a-react-app).
