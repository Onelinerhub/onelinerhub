# How can I use ReactJS and Vite together for software development?
// plain

ReactJS and Vite can be used together to create powerful software applications. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Vite is a modern build tool that provides a fast development setup and build experience.

Using ReactJS and Vite together, developers can create a development environment that is fast and efficient. Here is an example of how to set up a ReactJS and Vite project:

```
# Install Vite globally
npm install -g @vitejs/cli

# Create a new project
vite create my-project

# Install React and ReactDOM
npm install react react-dom
```

The above code will install Vite globally and create a new project called `my-project`. It will then install the React and ReactDOM libraries, which are necessary for creating React applications.

Next, developers need to configure Vite to use React. This can be done by adding the following code to the `vite.config.js` file in the project root:

```js
import { createReactAppConfig } from 'vite-plugin-react'

export default createReactAppConfig()
```

Finally, developers can start their development server with the following command:

```
vite
```

This will start a development server for the React application.

By using ReactJS and Vite together, developers can create powerful software applications quickly and efficiently.
