# How can I use Git with React.js?
// plain

Git is a version control system which can be used to track changes in source code. React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Using Git with React.js can help developers track changes in their code and collaborate on projects.

To use Git with React.js, first install Git on your machine. Then create a local repository for your project.

```
git init
```

Next, create a remote repository on a hosting service such as GitHub.

Then add the remote repository to your local repository.

```
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```

Now you can start pushing your React.js code to the remote repository.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master
```

Finally, you can use Git commands such as `git pull`, `git checkout`, and `git merge` to collaborate with other developers on the project.
