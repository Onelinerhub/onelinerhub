# How can I create a login page using React.js?
// plain

Creating a login page using React.js is a straightforward process. The following example code will create a login page with a username and password field.

```
import React from 'react';

class LoginForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { username: '', password: '' };
  }
  handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  };
  handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // do something with the username and password
  };
  render() {
    const { username, password } = this.state;
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Username:
          <input
            type="text"
            name="username"
            value={username}
            onChange={this.handleChange}
          />
        </label>
        <label>
          Password:
          <input
            type="password"
            name="password"
            value={password}
            onChange={this.handleChange}
          />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

This code will produce a form with two input fields for the username and password. The handleChange method is used to update the values of the username and password in the state, and the handleSubmit method is used to do something with the username and password when the form is submitted.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Import React from 'react': This imports the React library which is necessary for creating React components.
2. Create a LoginForm class which extends React.Component: This class is the component which will render the form.
3. Constructor: This sets the initial state of the component.
4. HandleChange method: This is used to update the username and password in the state when the user types in the input fields.
5. HandleSubmit method: This is used to do something with the username and password when the form is submitted.
6. Render method: This is used to render the form with the two input fields.
