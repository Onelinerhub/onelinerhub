# How do I use an online editor to develop with React.js?
// plain

Using an online editor to develop with React.js requires a few steps.

First, you'll need to create a project file. This can be done by setting up a folder with the files you need for your project, such as an `index.html`, `style.css` and `index.js` files.

Next, you'll need to include the React library in your project. This can be done by adding the following code to your `index.html` file:
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
```

After that, you'll need to write the React code in your `index.js` file. For example, the following code will render a `<h1>` element with the text "Hello World" to the page:
```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello World</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Finally, you'll need to add a `<div>` element with an `id` of `root` to your `index.html` file, like so:
```
<div id="root"></div>
```

Once all of these steps are completed, you can open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the rendered React code.
