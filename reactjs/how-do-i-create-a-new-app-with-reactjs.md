# How do I create a new app with ReactJS?
// plain

To create a new app with ReactJS, follow the steps below:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if it is not already installed.
2. Install the [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) package by running `npm install -g create-react-app` in the command line.
3. Create the React app by running `create-react-app <app-name>` in the command line.

## Example code

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app
```

## Output example

```
Success! Created my-app at C:\Users\username\my-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
```

The `create-react-app` command will create a new directory with the name of the app and will generate all the necessary files for a basic React app.

The `npm start` command will start the development server and open the app in the browser. The `npm run build` command will create a production version of the app.

For more information, check out the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
