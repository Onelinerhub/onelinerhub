# How do I create a React.js portal?
// plain

Creating a React.js portal requires several steps.

1. Create a React App:
   ```
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
   ```
   This will create a React application in the my-app directory.

2. Install React Router:
   ```
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```
   React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React, which helps in adding new screens and flows to the React application.

3. Configure the Router:
   Create a file called `App.js` in the `src` directory and add the following code:
   ```
   import React from 'react';
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <Route path="/" component={Home} />
       </Router>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```
   This configures the router to use the `Home` component when navigating to the `/` path.

4. Create Components:
   Create a file called `Home.js` in the `src` directory and add the following code:
   ```
   import React from 'react';

   function Home() {
     return <h1>Welcome to the React Portal!</h1>;
   }

   export default Home;
   ```
   This creates a `Home` component that will be rendered when navigating to the `/` path.

5. Start the App:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the React application and open it in the browser.

Now you have a basic React portal created.
