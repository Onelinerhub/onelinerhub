How do I use memoization in ReactJS?
// plain

Memoization is a technique used to improve the performance of React applications by caching the results of expensive calculations. It can be used to store the results of a function call and then reuse them when the same input is passed to the function. This can drastically reduce the number of calculations that need to be performed, resulting in improved performance.

To use memoization in ReactJS, you can use the useMemo hook. This hook will take a function and an array of dependencies as arguments. The dependencies are values that the memoized function depends on. When the dependencies change, the memoized function will be re-evaluated.

Here is an example of how to use the useMemo hook:

```
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

In this example, the function `computeExpensiveValue` is memoized based on the values of `a` and `b`. The function will only be re-evaluated when the values of `a` and `b` change.

The parts of the code are:

- `memoizedValue`: This is the variable that will store the memoized value.
- `useMemo`: This is the React hook that is used to memoize a function.
- `() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b)`: This is the function that will be memoized.
- `[a, b]`: This is an array of the dependencies of the memoized function.
