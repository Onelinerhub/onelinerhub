# How can I learn React.js?
// plain

React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used by many companies and developers in their web applications. To get started with React.js, you need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To learn React.js, you can start by reading the official documentation on the React website. It provides a comprehensive overview of the library and its features. Additionally, there are many tutorials and guides available online that can help you get a better understanding of the library.

You can also try out some example code to get a better feel for React.js. Below is an example of a simple React component that renders a "Hello World" message:

```
import React from 'react';

function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

This code will output:
```
Hello World!
```

The code consists of three parts:
- The `import` statement imports the React library.
- The `function` declaration defines a new React component.
- The `export` statement makes the component available to other parts of the application.

You can also practice React.js by building your own projects. There are plenty of tutorials and resources available online that can help you get started.
