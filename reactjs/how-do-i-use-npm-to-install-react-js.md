# How do I use npm to install React.js?
// plain

NPM (Node Package Manager) is a command line tool used for installing packages from the Node.js package registry. It can be used to install React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

To install React.js using NPM, open a command line terminal and type the following command:

```
npm install react
```

This will install the latest version of React.js in the node_modules directory.

The command will also install any other required dependencies, such as ReactDOM and ReactDOMServer.

Once the installation is complete, you can import React into your project using the following code:

```
import React from 'react';
```

You can then use React components in your project.

Parts of the Code:
1. `npm install react` - This command installs the latest version of React.js in the node_modules directory.
2. `import React from 'react';` - This imports the React library into your project.
