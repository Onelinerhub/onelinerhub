# How can I configure Nginx to use React.js?
// plain

To configure Nginx to use React.js, you need to set up the Nginx server and the React.js application.

First, you need to install Nginx. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Next, you need to create a configuration file for the Nginx server. This file should contain the following code:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /path/to/react/app/build;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }
}
```

The code above will configure the Nginx server to serve the React.js application from the `/path/to/react/app/build` directory.

Finally, you need to restart the Nginx server for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo service nginx restart
```

After restarting the server, the React.js application should be available at `example.com`.

## Code explanation

- `sudo apt-get install nginx`: Installs Nginx
- `server {...}`: Configures the Nginx server
- `try_files $uri /index.html`: Tries to serve the requested file, if not found serves `index.html`
- `sudo service nginx restart`: Restarts the Nginx server
