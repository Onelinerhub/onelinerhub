# How do I use ReactJS to create an example XLSX file?
// plain

ReactJS is a JavaScript library that can be used to create user interfaces. It can also be used to create an example XLSX file. The following example code will create an XLSX file with a single sheet with two rows and two columns of data.

```
import React from 'react';
import { XLSX } from 'xlsx';

const data = [
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
];

const ws = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet(data);
const wb = XLSX.utils.book_new();
XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, 'Sheet1');
XLSX.writeFile(wb, 'example.xlsx');
```

This code will create a file called `example.xlsx` with the following data:

|   | A | B |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 4 |

The code can be broken down as follows:

1. `import React from 'react'`: This imports the React library.
2. `import { XLSX } from 'xlsx'`: This imports the XLSX library which will be used to create the XLSX file.
3. `const data = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`: This creates a two-dimensional array which contains the data to be written to the XLSX file.
4. `const ws = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet(data)`: This converts the two-dimensional array to a worksheet object.
5. `const wb = XLSX.utils.book_new()`: This creates a new workbook object.
6. `XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, 'Sheet1')`: This adds the worksheet object to the workbook object.
7. `XLSX.writeFile(wb, 'example.xlsx')`: This writes the workbook object to the file `example.xlsx`.
