# How do I create a logo using ReactJS?
// plain

Creating a logo using ReactJS is a great way to create a unique and professional look for your brand. To begin, you'll need to set up your React project. You can do this by creating a new folder and running `npx create-react-app your-app-name` in the command line.

Once you have your project set up, you can start creating your logo. To do this, you'll need to create a React component that will render the logo. This component should have a render method that returns a `<svg>` element containing the logo's SVG code.

For example, the following code will render an example logo:

```js
import React from 'react';

export default function Logo() {
  return (
    <svg
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      width="200"
      height="200"
      viewBox="0 0 200 200"
    >
      <rect x="50" y="50" width="100" height="100" fill="none" stroke="black" />
      <circle cx="125" cy="125" r="50" fill="red" />
    </svg>
  );
}
```

This code will render the following logo:

<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  width="200"
  height="200"
  viewBox="0 0 200 200"
>
  <rect x="50" y="50" width="100" height="100" fill="none" stroke="black" />
  <circle cx="125" cy="125" r="50" fill="red" />
</svg>

The code above consists of the following parts:

* `import React from 'react';`: This imports the React library.
* `export default function Logo() {`: This creates the Logo component.
* `<svg>`: This is the root SVG element, which contains the logo's code.
* `<rect>`: This draws a rectangle.
* `<circle>`: This draws a circle.
