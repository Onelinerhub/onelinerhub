# How do I use the ReactJS toolkit?
// plain

ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create interactive UIs, manage component states, and render views for each state in your application.

To use ReactJS, you need to install the ReactJS library. This can be done with the following command:
```
npm install react
```

Once ReactJS is installed, you can start building components. Components are the building blocks of ReactJS and are used to create the UI. Components can be written in either JavaScript or JSX, which is a syntax extension to JavaScript.

Here is an example of a ReactJS component written in JSX:
```
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Once you have written your components, you can render them in your application with the ReactDOM library. This library provides the methods to render components to the DOM.

Here is an example of how to render a component:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
