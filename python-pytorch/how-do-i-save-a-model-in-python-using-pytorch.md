# How do I save a model in Python using PyTorch?
// plain

To save a model in Python using PyTorch, you can use the `torch.save` function. This will save the model parameters to a file, which can then be used to reload the model.

## Example code

```
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pt')
```

This will save the model parameters to a file named `model.pt` in the current working directory.

The code consists of two parts:
1. `model.state_dict()`: This will get the state of the model, which contains the parameters of the model.
2. `torch.save`: This will save the state of the model to the specified file.

For more information, see the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/serialization.html).
