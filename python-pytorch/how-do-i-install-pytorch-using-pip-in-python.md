// plain

Installing PyTorch using pip is a straightforward process. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check the version of Python installed by running the following command in the terminal:
```python -V```

2. Install the latest version of pip by running the following command:
```python -m pip install --upgrade pip```

3. Install PyTorch using the following command:
```pip install torch torchvision```

4. Verify the installation by running the following command in the terminal:
```python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"```

This should output the version of PyTorch installed.

5. To install PyTorch for a specific version of Python, specify the version number in the command. For example, to install PyTorch for Python 3.7, use the following command:
```pip3.7 install torch torchvision```

6. To install a specific version of PyTorch, specify the version number in the command. For example, to install version 1.3.1, use the following command:
```pip install torch==1.3.1 torchvision==0.4.2```

7. To install PyTorch with GPU support, use the following command:
```pip install torch torchvision cudatoolkit```
