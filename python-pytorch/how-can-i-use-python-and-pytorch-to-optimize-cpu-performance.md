# How can I use Python and PyTorch to optimize CPU performance?
// plain

Python and PyTorch can be used to optimize CPU performance in a variety of ways. First, Python can be used to write efficient code that can be compiled to run faster on the CPU. Second, PyTorch can be used to speed up the training of deep learning models on the CPU.

Example code using Python to optimize CPU performance:
```
import time

def time_function(func):
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    start = time.time()
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    end = time.time()
    print("Function took {} seconds".format(end - start))
    return result
  return wrapper

@time_function
def function_to_time():
  for i in range(1000000):
    pass

function_to_time()
```
## Output example

```
Function took 0.06511306762695312 seconds
```

The code above uses the `time` module to time the execution of the `function_to_time` function. The `time_function` decorator is used to measure the time taken to execute the function, and the result is printed to the console.

Example code using PyTorch to optimize CPU performance:
```
import torch

# Set the device to use
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Create a model
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1).to(device)

# Define an optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the model
for i in range(100):
   optimizer.step()
```

The code above uses PyTorch to create a linear model and an Adam optimizer. The model is then trained for 100 iterations using the optimizer. By using PyTorch, we can take advantage of the GPU to speed up the training process.

## Code explanation


1. `import time`: Imports the `time` module to be used for timing the execution of functions.
2. `def time_function(func):`: Defines a decorator `time_function` which takes a function as an argument and is used to measure the time taken to execute the function.
3. `@time_function`: Applies the `time_function` decorator to the `function_to_time` function.
4. `import torch`: Imports the PyTorch module to be used for creating and training a model.
5. `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")`: Sets the device to use for training the model.
6. `model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1).to(device)`: Creates a linear model with 10 input features and 1 output.
7. `optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)`: Creates an Adam optimizer which is used to train the model.
8. `optimizer.step()`: Steps the optimizer to train the model for one iteration.
