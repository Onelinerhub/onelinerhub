# How can I use PyTorch with Python 3.8 on a Jetson device?
// plain

Using PyTorch with Python 3.8 on a Jetson device is possible with the help of the JetPack SDK. The JetPack SDK provides a complete development environment for the Jetson platform, including the necessary libraries and tools to build and deploy applications.

To use PyTorch with Python 3.8 on a Jetson device, first install the JetPack SDK. This can be done by downloading the JetPack SDK from the NVIDIA developer website and following the instructions to install it on the device.

Once the JetPack SDK is installed, you can install PyTorch. This can be done using the pip command in the terminal, like so:
```
pip3 install torch torchvision
```

You can then use PyTorch with Python 3.8 on the Jetson device. Here is an example of using PyTorch to train a simple neural network on the Jetson device:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# define a simple neural network
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 5),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(5, 2),
    nn.Softmax(dim=1)
)

# define an optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# train the model
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(output, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data.

## Code explanation

1. `pip3 install torch torchvision`: This command uses pip to install the PyTorch and torchvision packages on the Jetson device.
2. `model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 5), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(5, 2), nn.Softmax(dim=1))`: This line creates a simple neural network with two linear layers and two non-linear activation functions.
3. `optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)`: This line creates an Adam optimizer to train the neural network.
4. `for epoch in range(100):`: This loop trains the model for 100 epochs.
5. `optimizer.zero_grad()`: This line resets the gradients of the neural network before training.
6. `output = model(inputs)`: This line runs the inputs through the neural network and stores the output.
7. `loss = criterion(output, targets)`: This line calculates the loss between the output of the neural network and the target labels.
8. `loss.backward()`: This line calculates the gradients of the neural network.
9. `optimizer.step()`: This line updates the weights of the neural network using the gradients.
