# How can I use Python Torch to create a Tensor?
// plain

Using Python Torch to create a Tensor is easy. Here is an example of how to do it:

```
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Print out the tensor
print(x)
```

The output of the above code will be:
```
tensor([[1, 2],
        [3, 4]])
```

The code can be broken down into the following parts:
1. `import torch`: This imports the torch library, which provides the tools for creating and manipulating tensors.
2. `x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`: This creates a 2x2 tensor with the given values.
3. `print(x)`: This prints out the tensor.

For more information on how to use Python Torch to create and manipulate tensors, please refer to the [PyTorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).
