To use PyTorch with Python 3.11 on Windows, you will need to install both Python 3.11 and PyTorch.

1. Install Python 3.11:
You can install Python 3.11 from the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-311/). Make sure you download the version for Windows.

2. Install PyTorch:
You can install PyTorch from the [PyTorch downloads page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Make sure you select the correct version of Python and Windows.

3. Verify Installation:
Once both Python 3.11 and PyTorch are installed, you can verify that everything is working correctly by running the following code in the Python interpreter:

```
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
```

## Output example

```
1.7.0
```

You should see the version of PyTorch that you have installed printed out.

Now you should be able to use PyTorch with Python 3.11 on Windows.
