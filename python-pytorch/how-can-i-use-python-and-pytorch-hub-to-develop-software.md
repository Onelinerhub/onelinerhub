# How can I use Python and PyTorch Hub to develop software?
// plain

PyTorch Hub is a library that enables developers to quickly and easily build software applications using PyTorch. It provides a set of pre-trained models that can be used in applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and other deep learning tasks.

Using PyTorch Hub, developers can easily create software applications with minimal effort. Here is an example of how to use PyTorch Hub to develop a software application:

```
import torch
import torchvision
import torch.nn as nn

# Load a pre-trained model from PyTorch Hub
model = torch.hub.load('pytorch/vision', 'resnet18', pretrained=True)

# Define a new classification layer
model.fc = nn.Linear(512, 10)

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y)
```

The code above loads a pre-trained model from PyTorch Hub, defines a new classification layer, and then trains the model.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import` statements: imports the `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torch.nn` modules.
2. `torch.hub.load`: loads a pre-trained model from PyTorch Hub.
3. `nn.Linear`: defines a new classification layer.
4. `model.fit`: trains the model.
