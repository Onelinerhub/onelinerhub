# How can I use Python and PyTorch on an AMD processor?
// plain

Using Python and PyTorch on an AMD processor is possible with the Anaconda distribution. Anaconda is a free and open source package manager for Python and R that helps you install and manage packages.

The Anaconda distribution includes the PyTorch package, which can be used on AMD processors. To install PyTorch on an AMD processor, you can use the following commands:

```
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
```

This will install PyTorch on an AMD processor. You can then use the PyTorch library to create neural networks and other deep learning models.

To use Python and PyTorch on an AMD processor, you need to have the following installed:

1. Anaconda distribution
2. PyTorch package
3. CUDA Toolkit

Once these components are installed, you can use the PyTorch library to create neural networks and other deep learning models.
