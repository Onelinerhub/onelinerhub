# How do I install the dependencies for using Python and PyTorch?
// plain

In order to use Python and PyTorch, you must first install the necessary dependencies.

1. Install Python:

Python is a programming language that is used to create powerful and dynamic programs. To install Python, you can use your operating system's package manager or download the source code from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install PyTorch:

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python. To install PyTorch, you can use `pip`:

```
$ pip install torch
```

3. Install other dependencies:

You may also need to install other dependencies, such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. To install these, you can use `pip` as well:

```
$ pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

You may also need to install other libraries, such as OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, and Pandas. For more information on installing these libraries, you can refer to the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/installation.html).

Once all the dependencies are installed, you are ready to use Python and PyTorch!
