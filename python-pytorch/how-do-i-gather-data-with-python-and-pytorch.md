# How do I gather data with Python and PyTorch?
// plain

Python and PyTorch provide several different methods for gathering data.

The most common method is to use Python's `urllib` library to download data from a web server. For example, the following code block will download a file from a URL and save it to the local filesystem:

```python
import urllib.request

url = 'http://example.com/file.txt'
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, 'file.txt')
```

This will download the file located at the specified URL and save it as `file.txt` in the current directory.

Another method is to use `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` to load data from a dataset. This is useful for datasets that are too large to fit into memory. For example, the following code block will load a dataset of images from a directory:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

dataset = torch.utils.data.DatasetFolder('path/to/dataset/')
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)

for batch in data_loader:
    # Process batch
```

This will load the dataset from the specified directory and create a `DataLoader` object which can be used to iterate over the dataset in batches.

Finally, PyTorch also provides a `torch.utils.data.TensorDataset` class which can be used to load data from a `torch.Tensor` object. For example, the following code block will load a dataset of images from a `torch.Tensor` object:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset

dataset = TensorDataset(torch.Tensor(data))
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)

for batch in data_loader:
    # Process batch
```

This will load the dataset from the specified `torch.Tensor` object and create a `DataLoader` object which can be used to iterate over the dataset in batches.

These are just a few of the methods available for gathering data with Python and PyTorch. For more information, see the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html).
