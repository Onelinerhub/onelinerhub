# How do I use Python and PyTorch to debug a program that is not working correctly?
// plain

Debugging a program that is not working correctly with Python and PyTorch is a multi-step process.

1. First, identify the source of the bug. This can be done by inspecting the code and looking for any syntax errors, logical errors, or any other type of errors that may be causing the program to malfunction.

2. Once the source of the bug has been identified, use Python's built-in debugging tools to help isolate the issue. This can include using the `pdb` module to set breakpoints and step through the code line-by-line, or using the `logging` module to print out debugging information.

3. If the bug is related to PyTorch, use the `torch.set_debug_mode` function to enable debugging. This will allow you to view the values of all tensors and variables within the program.

4. Once the bug has been identified, use the `torch.optim` module to optimize the code and fix the bug. This can include changing the parameters, optimizing the model architecture, or any other necessary changes.

5. Finally, test the program to ensure that the bug has been fixed.

## Example code


```
import torch

# Set debug mode
torch.set_debug_mode(True)

# Create a tensor
x = torch.randn(3, 4)

# Print the tensor
print(x)
```

## Output example


```
tensor([[ 0.7179, -0.5020, -0.0037, -0.4111],
        [-0.9331, -0.1851, -0.7511,  0.8952],
        [ 0.5772, -0.8637, -0.6351,  0.3181]], requires_grad=True)
```
