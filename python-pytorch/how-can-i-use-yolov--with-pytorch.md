# How can I use Yolov5 with PyTorch?
// plain

Yolov5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model based on PyTorch. It can be used for a variety of tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

To use Yolov5 with PyTorch, you need to first install the PyTorch library and the Yolov5 library. To install the PyTorch library, you can use `pip install torch` or `conda install pytorch`. To install the Yolov5 library, you can use `pip install yolov5` or `conda install yolov5`.

Once the libraries are installed, you can use the following example code to detect objects in an image using Yolov5 and PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import yolov5

# Load an image
img = torch.randn(3, 224, 224)

# Create a Yolov5 model
model = yolov5.Yolov5(weights_file='weights.pt')

# Detect objects in the image
detections = model(img)

# Print the detections
print(detections)
```

## Output example

```
[{'class': 'person', 'bbox': [x1, y1, x2, y2], 'score': 0.8},
{'class': 'dog', 'bbox': [x1, y1, x2, y2], 'score': 0.7}]
```

The code above:
- Imports the `torch` and `yolov5` libraries (line 1-2)
- Loads an image (line 4)
- Creates a Yolov5 model (line 6)
- Detects objects in the image (line 8)
- Prints the detections (line 10)
