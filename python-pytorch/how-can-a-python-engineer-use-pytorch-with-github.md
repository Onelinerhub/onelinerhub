# How can a Python engineer use PyTorch with GitHub?
// plain

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library for Python that can be used with GitHub. It provides a wide range of algorithms for deep learning and other applications. To use PyTorch with GitHub, a Python engineer can:

1. Create a GitHub repository for their PyTorch project.
2. Install PyTorch on their machine using either the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package managers.
3. Write their PyTorch code and commit it to the GitHub repository.

For example, a Python engineer can create a simple PyTorch neural network as follows:

```
import torch

# Create a neural network
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(2, 4),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(4, 1)
)

# Print the model
print(model)
```

## Output example

```
Sequential(
  (0): Linear(in_features=2, out_features=4, bias=True)
  (1): ReLU()
  (2): Linear(in_features=4, out_features=1, bias=True)
)
```

Once the code is written, the Python engineer can commit it to the GitHub repository and share it with other engineers.
