# How can I calculate the mean value using Python and PyTorch?
// plain

Calculating the mean value using Python and PyTorch is relatively simple. To do this, you will need to import the torch library and create a tensor with the values you want to calculate the mean of.

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor with values
values = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])

# Calculate the mean
mean_val = torch.mean(values)

# Print the mean
print(mean_val)
```

## Output example

```
tensor(2.5000)
```

The code above consists of:

1. Importing the torch library: This imports the torch library so that it can be used in the code.
2. Creating a tensor with values: This creates a tensor with the values you want to calculate the mean of.
3. Calculating the mean: This uses the torch.mean() function to calculate the mean of the values in the tensor.
4. Printing the mean: This prints the mean value.
