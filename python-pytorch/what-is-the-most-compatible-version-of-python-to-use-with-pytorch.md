# What is the most compatible version of Python to use with PyTorch?
// plain

The most compatible version of Python to use with PyTorch is Python 3.6. PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features: tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. Python 3.6 is the most recommended version to use with PyTorch, as it has the most stable version of the libraries needed for deep learning.

```
# Example code
import torch
print(torch.__version__)

```
## Output example
 `1.6.0`

The code above imports the PyTorch library and prints out the version number. As of this writing, the latest version of PyTorch is 1.6.0, which is compatible with Python 3.6.

## Code explanation


- `import torch`: This imports the PyTorch library into the current Python environment.
- `print(torch.__version__)`: This prints out the version number of the PyTorch library.
