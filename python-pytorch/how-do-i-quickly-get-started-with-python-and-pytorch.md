# How do I quickly get started with Python and PyTorch?
// plain

To quickly get started with Python and PyTorch, follow the steps below:

1. Install Python 3.7 or higher from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install PyTorch from [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/) depending on your system configuration.
3. Check your installation with a simple program:

```
import torch
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([[0.6388, 0.4874, 0.8468],
        [0.6561, 0.8299, 0.1067],
        [0.9170, 0.9279, 0.7705],
        [0.9079, 0.9336, 0.2668],
        [0.0090, 0.8908, 0.9288]])
```

4. Start coding with PyTorch. For example, you can use the following code to create a tensor and print it:

```
import torch
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(x)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([[1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]])
```

5. Find tutorials and documentation on [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) to learn more about PyTorch.
6. Join the [PyTorch community](https://pytorch.org/community/) to connect with other PyTorch users and get help if needed.
7. Explore the [PyTorch examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html) to understand the basics of using PyTorch.
