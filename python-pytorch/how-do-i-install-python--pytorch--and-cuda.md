1. Install Python:
   - Download the Python installer from [Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Python on your computer.

2. Install PyTorch:
   - Depending on your system, you can install PyTorch from [PyTorch's website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) using either pip or conda.
   - For example, if you are using pip, you can install PyTorch by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision

4. Verify the Installation:
   - To verify that the installation is successful, you can run the following command:
   ```
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
   ```
   - The output should be the version of PyTorch that you have installed.

By following these steps, you will have successfully installed Python, PyTorch, and CUDA on your computer.
