# How do I create a Python PyTorch cheat sheet?
// plain

Creating a Python PyTorch cheat sheet is a great way to quickly reference commonly used code snippets and understand how they work. Here are some steps to get you started:

1. Select the topics you want to include in your cheat sheet. This could include basic operations such as tensor creation and manipulation, data loading, and model training.

2. For each topic, provide an example code block and output (if any) enclosed with ```.

```
import torch
x = torch.tensor([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
print(x)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([[1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]])
```

3. Break down each code block into smaller parts and explain them in detail.

- `import torch`: This imports the PyTorch library.
- `x = torch.tensor([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])`: This creates a 2D tensor with the given values.
- `print(x)`: This prints the tensor.

4. Include a list of relevant links for further reading and exploring the topic.

- [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- [PyTorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/)

5. Review your cheat sheet to make sure it is accurate and complete.

6. Share your cheat sheet with others to help them learn and understand PyTorch better.

7. Update your cheat sheet regularly with new topics and code snippets.
