# How do I use Python and PyTorch to solve a specific problem?
// plain

Python and PyTorch can be used to solve a specific problem by writing a program that uses PyTorch's library of modules to create a model that can be used to solve the problem. For example, if you wanted to use PyTorch to build a neural network that can classify images, you could write the following code:

```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()

        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, padding=1)

        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)

        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 4 * 4, 500)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(500, 10)

        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.25)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv3(x)))

        x = x.view(-1, 64 * 4 * 4)
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = NeuralNetwork()
```

This code creates a convolutional neural network that can be used to classify images. It consists of three convolutional layers, a max pooling layer, two fully connected layers, and a dropout layer. The forward method defines how the network will process a given input, and the model is instantiated at the end.

## Code explanation


1. `import torch`: Imports the PyTorch library.
2. `import torch.nn as nn`: Imports the PyTorch neural network module.
3. `class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):`: Defines a class for the neural network.
4. `def __init__(self):`: Defines the initialization method for the neural network.
5. `self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3, padding=1)`: Creates a convolutional layer with three input channels, 16 output channels, and a 3x3 kernel size.
6. `self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)`: Creates a max pooling layer with a 2x2 kernel size.
7. `self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 4 * 4, 500)`: Creates a fully connected layer with 64x4x4 input size and 500 output size.
8. `self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.25)`: Creates a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.25.
9. `def forward(self, x):`: Defines the forward method for the neural network.
10. `model = NeuralNetwork()`: Instantiates the neural network.
