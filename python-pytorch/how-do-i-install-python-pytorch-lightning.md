# How do I install Python PyTorch Lightning?
// plain

1. Installing PyTorch Lightning is easy and can be done in a few steps. First, you need to install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) on your system.

2. Once PyTorch is installed, you can install PyTorch Lightning using the following command:

```
pip install pytorch-lightning
```

3. After installation is complete, you can verify the installation by running the following command:

```
python -c "import torch; import pytorch_lightning"
```

4. If the installation is successful, the output should be `<Module 'torch' from '<path_to_torch>'>` and `<Module 'pytorch_lightning' from '<path_to_pytorch_lightning>'>`

5. You can also install PyTorch Lightning from source. To do this, clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) and run the following command:

```
python setup.py install
```

6. After the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by running the same command as in step 3.

7. To learn more about PyTorch Lightning, you can refer to the official [documentation](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
