// plain

Python and PyTorch can be used on Windows by following these steps:

1. Download and install the latest version of Python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the PyTorch package using the command `pip install torch` in the command prompt.

3. To verify that PyTorch has been successfully installed, run the following code:
```
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
```
## Output example
 `1.7.1`

4. Install the PyTorch library from the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

5. To verify that the PyTorch library has been successfully installed, run the following code:
```
import torchvision
print(torchvision.__version__)
```
## Output example
 `0.8.2`

6. To use PyTorch on Windows, you may also need to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

7. Finally, you can now start using Python and PyTorch on your Windows machine.
