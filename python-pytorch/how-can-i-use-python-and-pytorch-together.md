# How can I use Python and PyTorch together?
// plain

Python and PyTorch can be used together to create powerful, deep learning models. PyTorch is a Python-based library that provides powerful tools for deep learning development and training. With PyTorch, you can easily create and train deep learning models using Python.

## Example code

```
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Perform a matrix multiplication
y = torch.matmul(x, x)

print(y)
```
## Output example

```
tensor([[ 7, 10],
        [15, 22]])
```

The code above shows how to use Python and PyTorch together. First, we import the torch library. Then, we create a tensor, which is a multi-dimensional array. Finally, we use the torch.matmul() function to perform a matrix multiplication on the tensor.

In addition to the example code above, there are many other ways to use Python and PyTorch together. For example, you can use PyTorch to build and train neural networks, perform natural language processing, and more.

## Code explanation

1. `import torch`: Imports the PyTorch library.
2. `x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`: Creates a tensor, which is a multi-dimensional array.
3. `y = torch.matmul(x, x)`: Performs a matrix multiplication on the tensor.
4. `print(y)`: Prints the result of the matrix multiplication.
