# How can I configure Python PyTorch CUDA allocations?
// plain

To configure Python PyTorch CUDA allocations, you first need to check if your system has a CUDA-capable GPU and if it is supported by PyTorch. This can be done by running the following code:

```
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

If the output is `True`, your system is CUDA-capable and supports PyTorch.

To configure the CUDA allocations, you need to set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. This can be done by running the following code:

```
import os
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"]="0"
```

This will set the environment variable to allow access to the 0th GPU device.

You can also specify multiple GPU devices by setting the environment variable to a comma-separated list of device numbers, for example:

```
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"]="0,1"
```

This will set the environment variable to allow access to the 0th and 1st GPU devices.

You can also use the `torch.cuda.device_count()` function to get the number of available GPU devices and then use a loop to set the environment variable accordingly.

```
device_count = torch.cuda.device_count()
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = ",".join([str(i) for i in range(device_count)])
```

This will set the environment variable to allow access to all available GPU devices.

## Code explanation


1. `import torch`: imports the PyTorch library
2. `print(torch.cuda.is_available())`: prints a boolean value indicating if the system is CUDA-capable and supports PyTorch
3. `import os`: imports the os library
4. `os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"]="0"`: sets the environment variable to allow access to the 0th GPU device
5. `torch.cuda.device_count()`: returns the number of available GPU devices
6. `os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = ",".join([str(i) for i in range(device_count)])`: sets the environment variable to allow access to all available GPU devices
