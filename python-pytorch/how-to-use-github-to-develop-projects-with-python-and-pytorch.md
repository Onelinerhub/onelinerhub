# How to use GitHub to develop projects with Python and PyTorch?
// plain

GitHub is a great platform for developing projects with Python and PyTorch. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Create a GitHub account and sign in.
2. Create a new repository for your project.
3. Install the necessary libraries (e.g. Python, PyTorch) on your local machine.
4. Create a Python file for your project (e.g. `main.py`).

```python
import torch

# Define a neural network
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(32, 16),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(16, 8),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(8, 1)
)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

5. Push the project files to GitHub.
6. Collaborate with other developers on the project.
7. Monitor the project's progress with GitHub's tools.
