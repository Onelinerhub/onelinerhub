# How do I use a PyTorch optimizer in Python?

****

Using a PyTorch optimizer in Python is relatively simple.

First, you need to import the optimizer class from the PyTorch module. For example, to use the SGD optimizer, you would use the following code:

```
from torch.optim import SGD
```

Then, you need to create an instance of the optimizer class and pass in the parameters that you want to optimize. For example:

```
optimizer = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)
```

Finally, you need to call the optimizer’s step() method to update the model parameters. This should be done after every training batch:

```
optimizer.step()
```

In summary, the steps to use a PyTorch optimizer in Python are:

1. Import the optimizer class from the PyTorch module.
2. Create an instance of the optimizer class and pass in the parameters that you want to optimize.
3. Call the optimizer’s step() method to update the model parameters.
