# How can I use Python and PyTorch to build online applications?
// plain

Python and PyTorch can be used to build online applications in a variety of ways.

First, Python can be used to develop web applications using web frameworks such as Flask and Django. For example, the following code can be used to create a simple web application using Flask:
```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
The output of the code would be a web application running on localhost.

Second, PyTorch can be used to create machine learning models that can be used in web applications. For example, the following code can be used to create a simple machine learning model using PyTorch:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(3, 10)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = Model()
```
The output of the code would be a machine learning model which can be used in a web application.

Finally, Python and PyTorch can be used together to create web applications with machine learning capabilities. For example, the following code can be used to create a web application with a machine learning model:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from flask import Flask

class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(3, 10)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = Model()

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
The output of the code would be a web application running on localhost with a machine learning model.

In conclusion, Python and PyTorch can be used together to create web applications with machine learning capabilities.

#### List of Code Parts with Detailed Explanation

1. `from flask import Flask`: This line imports the Flask web framework.
2. `app = Flask(__name__)`: This line creates an instance of the Flask web framework.
3. `@app.route('/')`: This line creates a route for the web application.
4. `def hello_world():`: This line creates a function to be called when the route is accessed.
5. `return 'Hello World!'`: This line returns a string when the route is accessed.
6. `import torch`: This line imports the PyTorch library.
7. `import torch.nn as nn`: This line imports the PyTorch neural network library.
8. `class Model(nn.Module):`: This line creates a class for the machine learning model.
9. `def __init__(self):`: This line creates an initializer for the model class.
10. `super(Model, self).__init__()`: This line calls the parent class initializer.
11. `self.fc1 = nn.Linear(3, 10)`: This line creates a linear layer with 3 inputs and 10 outputs.
12. `self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 2)`: This line creates a linear layer with 10 inputs and 2 outputs.
13. `def forward(self, x):`: This line creates a forward pass function for the model.
14. `x = self.fc1(x)`: This line passes the input through the first linear layer.
15. `x = self.fc2(x)`: This line passes the output of the first layer through the second linear layer.
16. `return x`: This line returns the output of the second layer.
17. `model = Model()`: This line creates an instance of the model class.
18. `app.run()`: This line runs the web application.
