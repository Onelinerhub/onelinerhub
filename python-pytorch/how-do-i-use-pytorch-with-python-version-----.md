# How do I use PyTorch with Python version 3.11?
// plain

PyTorch is a deep learning library that works with Python version 3.11 and higher. To use PyTorch with Python 3.11, you need to install the library using the pip package manager.

## Example

```
pip install torch
```

The above command will install the latest version of PyTorch on your system. Once installed, you can import the library in your Python code and start using it.

## Example

```
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([[2, 3], [4, 5]])
print(x)

# Output
tensor([[2, 3],
        [4, 5]])
```

The above code snippet creates a tensor using the `torch.tensor()` function. You can also create tensors from existing data structures such as lists.

## Example

```
# Create a tensor from a list
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(x)

# Output
tensor([[1, 2],
        [3, 4]])
```

Once the tensor is created, you can perform various operations on it such as matrix multiplication, transpose, and more.
