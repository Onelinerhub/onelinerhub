# How do I use Python and PyTorch Geometric for software development?
// plain

Python and PyTorch Geometric are powerful tools for software development. PyTorch Geometric is a library for deep learning on irregularly structured input data such as graphs, point clouds, and manifolds. It provides a set of powerful tools and libraries for building and training neural networks with graph-structured data.

To use Python and PyTorch Geometric for software development, one needs to install the PyTorch Geometric library. The following example code shows how to install the library:

```
pip install torch-geometric
```

Once the library is installed, one can use the library to build and train neural networks with graph-structured data. For example, the following code shows how to build a simple graph neural network:

```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch_geometric.nn as pyg_nn

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = pyg_nn.GCNConv(2, 16)
        self.conv2 = pyg_nn.GCNConv(16, 2)

    def forward(self, data):
        x, edge_index = data.x, data.edge_index
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        return x
```

## Code explanation


* `pip install torch-geometric` - This line installs the PyTorch Geometric library.
* `import torch` - This line imports the PyTorch library.
* `import torch.nn as nn` - This line imports the PyTorch Neural Network library.
* `import torch_geometric.nn as pyg_nn` - This line imports the PyTorch Geometric Neural Network library.
* `class Net(nn.Module):` - This line defines the Net class which inherits from the PyTorch Neural Network library.
* `self.conv1 = pyg_nn.GCNConv(2, 16)` - This line creates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with 2 input channels and 16 output channels.
* `self.conv2 = pyg_nn.GCNConv(16, 2)` - This line creates a GCN with 16 input channels and 2 output channels.
* `x, edge_index = data.x, data.edge_index` - This line assigns the input data and edge index to variables.
* `x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)` - This line applies the first GCN to the input data.
* `x = torch.relu(x)` - This line applies the ReLU activation function to the output of the first GCN.
* `x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)` - This line applies the second GCN to the output of the first GCN.
* `return x` - This line returns the output of the second GCN.

By following the steps above, one can use Python and PyTorch Geometric for software development.
