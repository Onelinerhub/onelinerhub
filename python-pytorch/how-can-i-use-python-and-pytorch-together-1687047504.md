# How can I use Python and PyTorch together?
// plain

Python and PyTorch can be used together to create powerful machine learning models. PyTorch is a deep learning library that provides a high-level interface for creating and training neural networks. By combining Python and PyTorch, developers can create powerful machine learning models that can be used for a variety of tasks.

For example, the following code creates a simple neural network using PyTorch and trains it on a dataset:

```
import torch

# Create the neural network
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(2, 4),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(4, 1)
)

# Define the loss function
loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()

# Train the model
for epoch in range(1000):
    # Generate random data
    x = torch.randn(100, 2)
    y = x[:, 0] + x[:, 1]

    # Calculate the output of the model
    y_pred = model(x)

    # Calculate the loss
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)

    # Zero the gradients
    model.zero_grad()

    # Backpropagate the loss
    loss.backward()

    # Update the weights
    with torch.no_grad():
        for param in model.parameters():
            param -= 0.01 * param.grad

# Test the model
x = torch.randn(1, 2)
y_pred = model(x)
print(y_pred)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([[0.1143]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward>)
```

In this example, we:
1. Imported the PyTorch library
2. Created a simple neural network using the `torch.nn.Sequential` class
3. Defined a loss function using the `torch.nn.MSELoss` class
4. Generated random data for training
5. Calculated the output of the model using the `model()` function
6. Calculated the loss using the `loss_fn()` function
7. Backpropagated the loss
8. Updated the weights
9. Tested the model
