# How do I load a PyTorch model using Python?
// plain

To load a PyTorch model using Python, you will need to first import the necessary libraries. This includes `torch` and `torch.nn`:
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
```

Next, you need to define the model class with the same architecture as the model you are trying to load. This should include the same layers, activation functions, and other parameters as the model you are loading.

Then, you can use the `torch.load()` function to load the model parameters from a file. This will return a dictionary containing the model parameters, which you can then assign to the model class you defined earlier:
```
model = MyModel()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pt'))
```

Finally, you can use the `model.eval()` method to set the model to evaluation mode. This will ensure that the model behaves as expected when you use it for inference:
```
model.eval()
```

The following parts are included in the code above:
- `import torch` and `import torch.nn as nn`: imports the necessary libraries
- `model = MyModel()`: defines the model class with the same architecture as the model you are trying to load
- `model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pt'))`: loads the model parameters from a file
- `model.eval()`: sets the model to evaluation mode
