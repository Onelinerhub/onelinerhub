# What is the best version of Python to use with PyTorch?
// plain

The best version of Python to use with PyTorch is Python 3.7. PyTorch is officially supported on Python versions 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. Python 3.7 is the most recommended version for PyTorch as it has the most up-to-date features and bug fixes.

For example, the following code block shows how to check the version of Python used by PyTorch:

```
import torch

print(torch.__version__)
```

The output of this code would be the version of PyTorch currently installed, for example:

```
1.6.0
```

The main parts of this code are:

- `import torch`: imports the PyTorch library.
- `print(torch.__version__)`: prints the version of PyTorch currently installed.

For more information, please refer to the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).
