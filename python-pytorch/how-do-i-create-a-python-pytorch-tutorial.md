# How do I create a Python PyTorch tutorial?
// plain

1. First, you will need to install PyTorch. Instructions for this can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

2. Once installed, create a new Python file and import the PyTorch library:
```python
import torch
```

3. You can then create a tensor (a multi-dimensional array):
```python
x = torch.tensor([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
print(x)
```
## Output example

```
tensor([[1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]])
```

4. Next, you can perform operations on the tensor, such as adding a scalar to each element:
```python
y = x + 2
print(y)
```
## Output example

```
tensor([[3, 4, 5],
        [6, 7, 8]])
```

5. You can also perform matrix multiplication on tensors:
```python
z = torch.matmul(x, y)
print(z)
```
## Output example

```
tensor([[21, 27, 33],
        [57, 72, 87]])
```

6. You can also use PyTorch to build neural networks. For more information on this, see the official [PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).

7. Finally, you can use PyTorch to train and evaluate your models. For more information on this, see the official [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).
