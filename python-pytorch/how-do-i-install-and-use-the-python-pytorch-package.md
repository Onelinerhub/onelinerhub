# How do I install and use the Python PyTorch package?
// plain

1. First, you need to install PyTorch. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
`pip install torch torchvision`

2. Next, you need to import the package in your python script. You can do this by adding the following line to the top of your script:
`import torch`

3. Once you have imported the package, you can use it to create tensors. A tensor is a multi-dimensional array. Here is an example of how to create a tensor:
```
x = torch.tensor([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
print(x)
```
## Output example

`tensor([[1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]])`

4. You can also use PyTorch to perform various mathematical operations on tensors. For example, you can add two tensors together using the `torch.add()` function:
```
x = torch.tensor([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
y = torch.tensor([[7,8,9],[10,11,12]])
z = torch.add(x,y)
print(z)
```
## Output example

`tensor([[ 8, 10, 12],
        [14, 16, 18]])`

5. PyTorch also provides a variety of other features, such as support for deep learning and GPU acceleration. You can find more information about the features of PyTorch in the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).

6. You can also find tutorials and examples of how to use PyTorch on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).

7. Finally, if you need help with any PyTorch related issues, you can ask for help on the [PyTorch forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org/).
