# How can I use PyTorch with Python 3.11?
// plain

PyTorch is a deep learning library that can be used with Python 3.11. It provides a high-level API for building and training deep learning models. To use PyTorch with Python 3.11, you first need to install it. You can do this with the command `pip install torch` or `pip3 install torch`.

Once you have installed PyTorch, you can start using it with Python 3.11. To demonstrate, here is an example of a simple neural network written in PyTorch:

```
import torch

# define the network
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(2, 3),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(3, 1)
)

# define the input and output
x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]])
y = torch.tensor([[2.0]])

# train the network
loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(100):
    # forward pass
    y_pred = model(x)

    # compute and print loss
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}: loss {loss.item():.4f}')

    # zero the gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # backward pass
    loss.backward()

    # take a step with the optimizer
    optimizer.step()
```

The output of the example code above will be the loss value for each epoch:

```
Epoch 1: loss 4.0000
Epoch 2: loss 3.3840
Epoch 3: loss 2.8402
...
Epoch 99: loss 0.0017
Epoch 100: loss 0.0015
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Importing the `torch` module: This imports the PyTorch library so that it can be used.
2. Defining the network: This defines the structure of the neural network, in this case a simple two-layer network.
3. Defining the input and output: This defines the input and output data that will be used to train the network.
4. Training the network: This is the main loop of the training process. It uses an optimizer to update the network parameters based on the gradients computed from the loss function.
