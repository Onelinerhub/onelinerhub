# How do I use Python Torch to list items?
// plain

Python Torch is an open source machine learning library for Python. It provides a wide range of algorithms for deep learning and other machine learning tasks. To list items using Python Torch, you can use the `torch.cat` function. This function combines a sequence of tensors along a given dimension and returns a single tensor.

## Example code

```
import torch

a = torch.tensor([1,2,3])
b = torch.tensor([4,5,6])

list_items = torch.cat((a,b))

print(list_items)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
```

The code above first imports the `torch` module. Then, it creates two tensors, `a` and `b`, which contain the items to be listed. Finally, it uses the `torch.cat` function to combine these two tensors into a single tensor, `list_items`, and prints the result.

The code is composed of the following parts:

1. `import torch`: imports the `torch` module, which provides the `torch.cat` function.
2. `a = torch.tensor([1,2,3])`: creates a tensor `a` containing the items `1, 2, 3`.
3. `b = torch.tensor([4,5,6])`: creates a tensor `b` containing the items `4, 5, 6`.
4. `list_items = torch.cat((a,b))`: uses `torch.cat` to combine the two tensors `a` and `b` into a single tensor `list_items`.
5. `print(list_items)`: prints the result.

For more information about the `torch.cat` function, please see the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.cat).
