# How can I use a GPU to run Python and PyTorch?
// plain

Using a GPU to run Python and PyTorch is relatively straightforward. Here is an example of code that can be used to check if a GPU is being used:

```
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")  # a CUDA device object
    print("CUDA is available")
else:
    print("CUDA is not available")
```

## Output example

```
CUDA is available
```

To use a GPU with PyTorch, the code needs to be modified to include the following components:

1. A device object that will be used to run operations on the GPU. This can be done with the following line of code: `device = torch.device("cuda")`.

2. A function that will transfer data from the CPU to the GPU. This can be done with the following line of code: `data = data.to(device)`.

3. A function that will transfer data from the GPU to the CPU. This can be done with the following line of code: `data = data.cpu()`.

4. A function that will run operations on the GPU. This can be done with the following line of code: `output = model(data)`.
