# How do I use the Python PyTorch library?
// plain

The Python PyTorch library is a powerful open-source machine learning library used for deep learning applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is based on the Torch library, developed at the University of California, Berkeley. Using PyTorch, developers can create neural networks with dynamic computational graphs, which can be used to build sophisticated models for a variety of tasks.

To use the Python PyTorch library, first install it using `pip install torch`. Then, import the library using `import torch`.

## Example code

```
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([[1,2], [3,4]])

# Print the tensor
print(x)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([[1, 2],
        [3, 4]])
```

The code above imports the PyTorch library and creates a tensor. Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays used in deep learning applications.

## Code explanation


- `import torch`: This imports the PyTorch library and makes it accessible to the code.
- `x = torch.tensor([[1,2], [3,4]])`: This creates a tensor with the given values.
- `print(x)`: This prints the tensor to the console.
