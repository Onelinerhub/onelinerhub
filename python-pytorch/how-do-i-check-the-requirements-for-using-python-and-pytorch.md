# How do I check the requirements for using Python and PyTorch?
// plain

1. To check the requirements for using Python and PyTorch, you should first check the official documentation for both.
2. Python's requirements can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. PyTorch's requirements can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
4. Generally, Python 3.6 or later is required, and PyTorch requires Python 3.6 or later, as well as a 64-bit processor.
5. To check your Python version, you can run the following code in your terminal:
```
python --version
```
6. Output should look something like this:
```
Python 3.7.6
```
7. You can also check the version of PyTorch you have installed with the following code:
```
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
```
8. Output should look something like this:
```
1.5.1
```
