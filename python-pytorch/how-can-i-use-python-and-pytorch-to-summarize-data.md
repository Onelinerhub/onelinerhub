# How can I use Python and PyTorch to summarize data?
// plain

Python and PyTorch can be used to summarize data in a variety of ways. One way is to use the `torch.sum()` function to sum up the values of a tensor. For example, if we have a tensor `x` of size `(3, 2)`:

```
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2],
                  [3, 4],
                  [5, 6]])
```

we can use `torch.sum()` to sum up the values of the tensor:

```
torch.sum(x)
# Output: 21
```

Another way to summarize data using Python and PyTorch is to use the `torch.mean()` function to calculate the mean of a tensor. For example, if we have a tensor `y` of size `(3, 2)`:

```
y = torch.tensor([[2, 4],
                  [6, 8],
                  [10, 12]])
```

we can use `torch.mean()` to calculate the mean of the tensor:

```
torch.mean(y)
# Output: 7
```

We can also use the `torch.std()` function to calculate the standard deviation of a tensor. For example, if we have a tensor `z` of size `(3, 2)`:

```
z = torch.tensor([[4, 8],
                  [12, 16],
                  [20, 24]])
```

we can use `torch.std()` to calculate the standard deviation of the tensor:

```
torch.std(z)
# Output: 5.656854249492381
```

These are just a few of the ways to summarize data using Python and PyTorch. For more information, see the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).
