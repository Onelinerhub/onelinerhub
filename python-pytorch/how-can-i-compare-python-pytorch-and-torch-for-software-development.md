# How can I compare Python PyTorch and Torch for software development?
// plain

Python PyTorch and Torch are two popular open-source libraries used in software development. PyTorch is a deep learning library based on the Torch library, which is a scientific computing framework.

PyTorch is a library for Python, while Torch is a library for Lua. PyTorch is more popular than Torch because it is easier to use and more intuitive. PyTorch also has a larger community of developers and users.

PyTorch is designed for efficient computing and better performance. It has a dynamic computational graph, which allows for easier debugging and faster model training. Torch, on the other hand, is a more traditional library and is designed for research and experimentation.

The following example shows how to use PyTorch to create a simple neural network:
```
import torch

# Define the network
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(4, 8),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(8, 3)
)

# Train the network
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
```

## Code explanation


1. `import torch`: This imports the PyTorch library.
2. `model = torch.nn.Sequential(...)`: This creates a neural network with four input nodes, eight hidden nodes, and three output nodes.
3. `criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`: This defines the loss function to use for training the network.
4. `optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)`: This defines the optimization algorithm to use for training the network.

Overall, PyTorch is better suited for deep learning applications, while Torch is better suited for research and experimentation.
