# How can I use Numba and PyTorch together for software development?
// plain

Numba and PyTorch can be used together for software development by leveraging Numba's ability to compile Python code to native machine code and PyTorch's deep learning library. This combination allows developers to quickly and efficiently create powerful machine learning models.

## Example code

```
import numba
import torch

@numba.jit
def my_function(x):
    return torch.sum(x)

x = torch.randn(3,3)

print(my_function(x))
```
## Output example

```
tensor(-0.2282)
```

The code above is an example of how Numba and PyTorch can be used together. The `@numba.jit` decorator is used to compile the `my_function` function to native machine code. This allows the function to be called more quickly and efficiently. Inside the function, PyTorch's `torch.sum()` function is used to sum the elements of the `x` tensor.

## Code explanation


1. Importing the `numba` and `torch` modules.
2. Adding the `@numba.jit` decorator to the `my_function` function.
3. Creating a `x` tensor using `torch.randn()`.
4. Calling the `my_function` function and passing in the `x` tensor.
5. Printing the output of the function.
