# How can I use the Python PyTorch API to develop a machine learning model?
// plain

To use the Python PyTorch API to develop a machine learning model, the following steps should be taken:

1. Install the PyTorch library, which can be done with the command `pip install torch`
2. Import the PyTorch library into your project with `import torch`
3. Create a dataset to train the model on. This can be done with the `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` class.
4. Define the network architecture with the `torch.nn` module. This can include layers, activation functions, and optimizers.
5. Train the model with the `torch.optim` module. This includes defining the loss function, setting the learning rate, and training the model.
6. Evaluate the model with the `torch.nn.functional` module. This includes calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
7. Deploy the model with the `torch.jit` module. This includes exporting the model to a file that can be used in production.

## Example code


```
import torch

# Create the dataset
dataset = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(...)

# Define the network
model = torch.nn.Sequential(...)

# Train the model
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Evaluate the model
metrics = torch.nn.functional.accuracy(output, labels)

# Deploy the model
torch.jit.save(model, 'model.pt')
```
