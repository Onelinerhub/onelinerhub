# How can I use Python 3.11 and PyTorch together?
// plain

Python 3.11 and PyTorch can be used together to perform deep learning tasks. PyTorch is a deep learning library that provides a wide range of algorithms and tools for deep learning applications.

To use Python 3.11 and PyTorch together, we need to install PyTorch from the official website. It is available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

## Example code

```
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.rand(5, 3)

# Print the tensor
print(x)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([[0.9085, 0.9283, 0.1790],
        [0.9082, 0.1645, 0.7537],
        [0.7222, 0.9072, 0.9241],
        [0.7490, 0.7709, 0.4207],
        [0.7802, 0.3525, 0.8248]])
```

Once PyTorch is installed, we can use it in Python 3.11 to perform deep learning tasks. The code above creates a tensor object and prints it.

## Code explanation


1. `import torch`: This imports the PyTorch library.
2. `x = torch.rand(5, 3)`: This creates a tensor object with 5 rows and 3 columns.
3. `print(x)`: This prints the tensor object.
