# How can I check if my Python code is compatible with PyTorch?
// plain

To check if your Python code is compatible with PyTorch, you can use the `torch.utils.cpp_extension.verify_ninja` function. This function will check if the compiler and library versions of your environment are compatible with PyTorch.

## Example code

```
import torch
torch.utils.cpp_extension.verify_ninja()
```

## Output example

```
Ninja found at '/usr/local/bin/ninja'
ninja version: 1.9.0
```

The `verify_ninja` function will check if the compiler and library versions of your environment are compatible with PyTorch. It will also check if the Ninja build system is installed.

You can also use the `torch.utils.cpp_extension.check_compiler_abi_compatibility` function to check if the compiler is compatible with PyTorch. This function will check if the compiler version is compatible with the version of PyTorch being used.

## Example code

```
import torch
torch.utils.cpp_extension.check_compiler_abi_compatibility()
```

## Output example

```
Compiler ABI compatibility check passed.
```

If the compiler ABI check fails, you will need to install a compatible compiler.

Finally, you can use the `torch.utils.cpp_extension.check_compile_succeeded` function to check if the compilation of your code was successful. This function will check if there are any errors in your code.

## Example code

```
import torch
torch.utils.cpp_extension.check_compile_succeeded()
```

## Output example

```
Compilation succeeded.
```

If the compilation fails, you will need to fix any errors in your code.
