# How can I use Python and PyTorch to develop applications for a Raspberry Pi?
// plain

Python and PyTorch can be used to develop applications for a Raspberry Pi. This can be done by installing the Python and PyTorch packages on the Raspberry Pi. The following example code will install the packages:

```
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install torch
```

Once the packages have been installed, you can write Python scripts using PyTorch to create applications for the Raspberry Pi. The scripts can be run using the Python interpreter. For example, the following code will print out "Hello World":

```
print("Hello World")
```

## Output example

```
Hello World
```

The code consists of two parts:
1. The `print()` function which is used to output a string of text to the console.
2. The string "Hello World" which is the text that is printed out.
