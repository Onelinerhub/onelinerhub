Python and PyTorch can be used together for deep learning. PyTorch is a deep learning framework that provides a comfortable Python environment for building neural networks and running computations. It offers a variety of tools and libraries that make it easy to construct deep learning models without having to write complex code.

## Example code

```
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.rand(5, 3)

# Print the tensor
print(x)
```
## Output example

```
tensor([[0.9804, 0.9402, 0.1316],
        [0.2780, 0.7355, 0.9888],
        [0.5120, 0.6648, 0.7117],
        [0.9447, 0.9594, 0.0537],
        [0.5067, 0.9662, 0.1319]])
```

The code above creates a tensor, which is a multi-dimensional array, and prints it. PyTorch provides many other functions for creating and manipulating tensors.

## Code explanation


1. `import torch`: Imports the PyTorch library.
2. `x = torch.rand(5, 3)`: Creates a tensor of size 5x3 and assigns it to the variable `x`.
3. `print(x)`: Prints the contents of the tensor `x`.
