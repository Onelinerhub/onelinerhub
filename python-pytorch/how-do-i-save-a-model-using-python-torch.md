# How do I save a model using Python Torch?
// plain

Saving a model using Python Torch is a simple process that can be done with the `torch.save()` function. This function takes two arguments: the model object to save and the file path to save it to.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
import torch

# Define model
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 5)

# Save model
torch.save(model, 'model.pt')
```

The `torch.save()` function will save the model to a file named `model.pt` in the current working directory.

## Code explanation

1. `import torch` - This imports the Torch library which is necessary for saving the model.
2. `model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 5)` - This creates a model object using the `torch.nn.Linear()` function.
3. `torch.save(model, 'model.pt')` - This saves the model object to a file named `model.pt` in the current working directory.
