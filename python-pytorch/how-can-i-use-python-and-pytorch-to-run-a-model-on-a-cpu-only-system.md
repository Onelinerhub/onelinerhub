# How can I use Python and PyTorch to run a model on a CPU only system?
// plain

You can use Python and PyTorch to run a model on a CPU only system by setting the device to 'cpu'. This can be done when creating the model, for example:

```
model = MyModel().to(device='cpu')
```

You can also set the device when running the model, for example:
```
output = model(inputs, device='cpu')
```

## Code explanation

* `MyModel()`: This is the model that you want to run on the CPU.
* `.to(device='cpu')`: This sets the device to the CPU.
* `model(inputs, device='cpu')`: This runs the model on the CPU.

For further information, see the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_attributes.html#torch-device) on setting the device.
