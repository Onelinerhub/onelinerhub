# How can I use PyTorch on Python 3.10?
// plain

PyTorch is a popular open source deep learning library for Python 3.10. It provides powerful tools for building and training neural networks. To use PyTorch on Python 3.10, you need to install the library with the following command:

```
pip install torch
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start using PyTorch by importing it in your code:

```python
import torch
```

You can then use PyTorch to define and train neural networks. For example, the following code creates a simple fully connected neural network with two hidden layers:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(in_features=784, out_features=256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(in_features=256, out_features=128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(in_features=128, out_features=10),
    nn.Softmax(dim=1)
)
```

Once the model is defined, you can train it by using the `torch.optim` package to define an optimizer and the `torch.nn.functional` package to define a loss function.

For more information on using PyTorch, please refer to the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).

## Code explanation
**

1. `import torch` - This imports the PyTorch library into your code, allowing you to use the library's functions and classes.
2. `nn.Sequential` - This creates a sequential model, which is a type of neural network composed of layers of neurons connected sequentially.
3. `nn.Linear` - This creates a linear layer of neurons, which is a basic type of layer commonly used in neural networks.
4. `nn.ReLU` - This creates a ReLU layer, which is a type of activation function commonly used in neural networks.
5. `nn.Softmax` - This creates a softmax layer, which is a type of activation function commonly used in neural networks.
6. `torch.optim` - This package provides tools for defining and optimizing neural networks.
7. `torch.nn.functional` - This package provides tools for defining loss functions for neural networks.
