# How can I convert a PyTorch Python model to C++?
// plain

The process of converting a PyTorch Python model to C++ is a multi-step process.

1. The first step is to export the PyTorch model to an intermediate representation (IR). ```torch.onnx.export(model, x, "model.onnx")```

2. The second step is to convert the IR to C++ code. This can be done using ONNX Runtime or ONNX.js.

3. After the C++ code is generated, it needs to be compiled and linked with the appropriate libraries.

4. The last step is to test the generated C++ code to ensure that the model is functioning correctly.

## Code explanation


1. Exporting the PyTorch model to an intermediate representation (IR): ```torch.onnx.export(model, x, "model.onnx")```

2. Converting the IR to C++ code: ONNX Runtime or ONNX.js

3. Compiling and linking the C++ code: CMake, Visual Studio, etc.

4. Testing the generated C++ code: unit tests, integration tests, etc.
