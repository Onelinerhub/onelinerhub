# How can I use Python and PyTorch to create a Zoom application?
// plain

Creating a Zoom application with Python and PyTorch can be done with a few main steps.

1. Install the necessary libraries. This can be done with `pip install pytorch` and `pip install zoom`

2. Create a Zoom meeting object. This can be done with the following code:

```
import zoom
zoom_meeting = zoom.Meeting()
```

3. Set up the necessary parameters for the meeting. This can be done with the following code:

```
zoom_meeting.set_topic('My Zoom Meeting')
zoom_meeting.set_timezone('America/New_York')
zoom_meeting.set_type('2')
```

4. Create a PyTorch model to be used in the meeting. This can be done with the following code:

```
import torch
model = torch.nn.Linear(3, 1)
```

5. Use the PyTorch model in the meeting. This can be done with the following code:

```
input = torch.randn(3)
output = model(input)
print(output)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([-0.3958], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)
```

6. Invite participants to the meeting. This can be done with the `zoom_meeting.invite()` method.

7. Start the meeting. This can be done with the `zoom_meeting.start()` method.
