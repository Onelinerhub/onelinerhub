# How do I use the Python PyTorch documentation to develop software?
// plain

The Python PyTorch documentation is an excellent resource for developing software with PyTorch. It contains comprehensive information on the PyTorch API, tutorials, and examples. To use the documentation, first read the tutorials to understand the basics of PyTorch. Then, use the API reference to look up the functions and classes you need to use.

For example, to use the `torch.nn.Conv2d` class, you can look up the documentation for this class to understand the parameters and how to use it.

```
import torch

# Create a Conv2d object
conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=10, kernel_size=3)

# Pass a tensor of shape (1, 3, 32, 32) through the Conv2d object
out = conv(torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32))

print(out.shape)
```

## Output example

`torch.Size([1, 10, 30, 30])`

The documentation also contains many code examples that you can use to help you understand how to use PyTorch. Additionally, there are links to other resources, such as tutorials and online courses.

## Code explanation

- `torch.nn.Conv2d`: This is a class from the PyTorch API used to create a 2D convolutional layer.
- `in_channels`: This is an integer parameter that specifies the number of input channels for the convolutional layer.
- `out_channels`: This is an integer parameter that specifies the number of output channels for the convolutional layer.
- `kernel_size`: This is an integer parameter that specifies the size of the convolutional kernel.
- `out = conv(torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32))`: This line passes a tensor with shape (1, 3, 32, 32) through the Conv2d object.
