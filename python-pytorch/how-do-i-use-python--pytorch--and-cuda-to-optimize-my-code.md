# How do I use Python, PyTorch, and CUDA to optimize my code?
// plain

Using Python, PyTorch, and CUDA together is a powerful combination that can help optimize code. The following example code block demonstrates how to use CUDA with PyTorch to speed up a simple matrix multiplication operation:

```
import torch
import torch.cuda

# Create two matrices
a = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cuda()
b = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cuda()

# Multiply the matrices
c = torch.mm(a, b)

# Print the result
print(c)
```

The output of this code will be a 1000x1000 matrix, which will be computed using CUDA and thus be much faster than a CPU-only operation.

The code can be broken down into the following parts:

1. Import the necessary libraries: `import torch` and `import torch.cuda`.
2. Create two matrices, `a` and `b`, and assign them to GPU memory using the `.cuda()` method.
3. Multiply the matrices using the `torch.mm()` method.
4. Print the result using the `print()` method.
