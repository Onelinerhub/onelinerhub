# How do I check which versions of Python are supported by PyTorch?
// plain

The easiest way to check which versions of Python are supported by PyTorch is to check the official [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html). On the right side of the page, you can find a list of the currently supported versions of Python.

In addition, you can also check the version of Python that PyTorch is using by running the following code:

```
import torch

print(torch.__version__)
```

The output of this code should look something like this:

```
1.6.0
```

This will tell you which version of Python PyTorch is using. You can then refer to the list on the PyTorch documentation page to see which versions are supported.
