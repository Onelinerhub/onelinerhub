# How can I use Python, PyTorch and Pip together to develop software?
// plain

Python, PyTorch, and Pip can be used together to develop software by utilizing their respective strengths. Pip is a package manager for Python which allows for the easy installation of packages and libraries for use with Python. PyTorch is a deep learning library for Python which provides a variety of machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.

Example code using Python, PyTorch, and Pip together to develop software:

```
# Install PyTorch package
pip install torch

# Import PyTorch library
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.randn(4, 3)

# Print the tensor
print(x)
```

## Output example

```
tensor([[-0.7143,  0.6729, -2.0267],
        [-1.4143, -0.7386, -0.8654],
        [-1.3984, -0.9084,  0.1618],
        [ 0.3703, -0.9072, -1.2562]])
```

The code consists of four parts:
1. Installing the PyTorch package using Pip
2. Importing the PyTorch library
3. Creating a tensor
4. Printing the tensor
