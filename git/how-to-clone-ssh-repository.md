# How to clone ssh repository

### Git supports SSH protocol, but you should make sure your [SSH keys are installed for git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-ssh-urls):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Onelinerhub/onelinerhub-ui.git
```

- `git` - base command
- `clone` - will clone repository from specified URL (onelinerhub.com UI in this case)

group: clone
