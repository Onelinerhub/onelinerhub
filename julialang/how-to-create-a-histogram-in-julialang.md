# How to create a histogram in JuliaLang?
// plain

Creating a histogram in JuliaLang is a simple process. The following example code block will create a histogram of a given array of numbers:
```
using Plots
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
histogram(x)
```
The code consists of the following parts:

1. `using Plots` - This imports the Plots library, which is necessary for creating a histogram.
2. `x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` - This creates an array of numbers to be used in the histogram.
3. `histogram(x)` - This creates the histogram of the given array.
