# How to use compat in JuliaLang?
// plain

JuliaLang provides a `Compat` module to help with compatibility between different versions of Julia. It provides a set of functions to help with version-specific code.

For example, the `@compat` macro can be used to wrap code that should only be executed in certain versions of Julia:
```julia
@compat v1.2 begin
    # code that should only be executed in Julia v1.2
end
```

The `Compat` module also provides functions to check the version of Julia, such as `isversion` and `isless`. These functions can be used to conditionally execute code based on the version of Julia:
```julia
if isless(VERSION, v"1.2")
    # code that should only be executed in Julia versions prior to v1.2
end
```

The `Compat` module also provides functions to check for the presence of certain features, such as `hasfeature` and `haskey`. These functions can be used to conditionally execute code based on the presence of certain features:
```julia
if hasfeature(:foo)
    # code that should only be executed if the :foo feature is present
end
```

For more information, see the [JuliaLang documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/compat/) on the `Compat` module.
