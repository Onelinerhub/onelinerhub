# How to work with matrices in JuliaLang?
// plain

Matrices in JuliaLang can be created using the `Matrix` type. For example, the following code creates a 3x3 matrix with all elements set to 0:
```
julia> A = Matrix{Int64}(undef, 3,3)
3Ã—3 Matrix{Int64}:
 140226928006080  140229222462352      1
 140226928810832  140229462810632     -1
 140229462810632  140229462810632  65793
```

To access elements of a matrix, use the `A[i,j]` syntax, where `i` and `j` are the row and column indices respectively. For example, to access the element at the second row and third column of the matrix `A` created above, use `A[2,3]`.

To perform operations on matrices, JuliaLang provides a variety of functions. For example, the `*` operator can be used to multiply two matrices, and the `inv` function can be used to calculate the inverse of a matrix.
