# How to test code in JuliaLang?
// plain

Testing code in JuliaLang is done using the `@test` macro. This macro allows you to write assertions that will be evaluated and checked for correctness. For example, the following code block will test if the variable `x` is equal to `2`:

```
using Test
@test x == 2
```

The output of this code will be either `Test Passed` or `Test Failed`.

The `@test` macro can also be used to test functions. For example, the following code block will test if the function `f(x)` returns `2` when given the argument `1`:

```
@test f(1) == 2
```

The output of this code will be either `Test Passed` or `Test Failed`.

The `@test` macro can also be used to test multiple assertions at once. For example, the following code block will test if the variable `x` is equal to `2` and the function `f(x)` returns `2` when given the argument `1`:

```
@test x == 2 && f(1) == 2
```

The output of this code will be either `Test Passed` or `Test Failed`.
