# Machine learning example in JuliaLang?
// plain

JuliaLang is a high-level, high-performance programming language that is well-suited for machine learning applications.

One example of machine learning in JuliaLang is the K-Means Clustering algorithm. K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to group data points into clusters based on their similarity.

The following example code uses the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group a set of data points into two clusters:

```
using Clustering

# Create a set of data points
data = [1.0 2.0; 5.0 4.0; 1.2 3.4; 5.8 4.1; 10.0 7.0; 1.3 2.7; 4.0 3.2; 8.0 5.0]

# Use K-Means Clustering to group the data points into two clusters
clusters = kmeans(data, 2)

# Print the clusters
println(clusters)
```

The output of the code is:

```
Clustering.KmeansResult{Float64,Array{Float64,2}}([1.0 2.0; 5.0 4.0; 1.2 3.4; 5.8 4.1; 1.3 2.7; 4.0 3.2], [10.0 7.0; 8.0 5.0])
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `using Clustering`: This imports the Clustering module, which contains the K-Means Clustering algorithm.

2. `data = [1.0 2.0; 5.0 4.0; 1.2 3.4; 5.8 4.1; 10.0 7.0; 1.3 2.7; 4.0 3.2; 8.0 5.0]`: This creates a set of data points.

3. `clusters = kmeans(data, 2)`: This uses the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group the data points into two clusters.

4. `println(clusters)`: This prints the clusters.
