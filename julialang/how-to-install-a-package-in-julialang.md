# How to install a package in JuliaLang?
// plain

Installing packages in JuliaLang is easy and straightforward. To install a package, use the `Pkg.add()` command. For example, to install the `DataFrames` package, use the following code:

```
Pkg.add("DataFrames")
```

This will install the package and all its dependencies.

The code consists of the following parts:

- `Pkg.add()`: This is the command used to install packages in JuliaLang.
- `"DataFrames"`: This is the name of the package to be installed.

For more information, see the [JuliaLang documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/).
