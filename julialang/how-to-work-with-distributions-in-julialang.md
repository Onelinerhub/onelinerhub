# How to work with distributions in JuliaLang?
// plain

JuliaLang is a powerful language for working with distributions. It provides a wide range of functions for working with probability distributions, including functions for generating random numbers, computing moments, and calculating probability density functions.

For example, to generate a random number from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, you can use the `randn()` function:

```julia
julia> randn()
-0.84500459909845
```

## Code explanation


- `rand()`: Generates a random number from a uniform distribution.
- `randn()`: Generates a random number from a normal distribution.
- `pdf()`: Calculates the probability density function for a given distribution.
- `cdf()`: Calculates the cumulative distribution function for a given distribution.
- `moment()`: Calculates the moments of a given distribution.
