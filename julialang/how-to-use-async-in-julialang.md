# How to use async in JuliaLang?
// plain

Async is a Julia package that provides a set of tools for writing asynchronous code. It allows you to write code that can run concurrently with other code, and can be used to improve the performance of your code.

## Example code

```julia
using Async

@async begin
    # Do some work
end
```

## Output example

```
Task (runnable) @0x00007f8f9f8f9f90
```

The code above uses the `@async` macro to create an asynchronous task. This task will run concurrently with other code, and can be used to improve the performance of your code.

The `@async` macro takes a block of code as an argument, and returns a `Task` object. This `Task` object can be used to control the execution of the asynchronous code.
