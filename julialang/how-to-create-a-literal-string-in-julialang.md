# How to create a literal string in JuliaLang?
// plain

A literal string in JuliaLang is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. For example, ```"Hello World!"``` is a literal string.

To create a literal string, you can use the following code:
```
my_string = "Hello World!"
```

The code consists of the following parts:
- `my_string`: the name of the variable that will store the string
- `=`: the assignment operator, which assigns the value on the right side of the operator to the variable on the left side
- `"Hello World!"`: the literal string

The output of the code will be:
```
"Hello World!"
```
