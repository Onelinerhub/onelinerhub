# How to use channels in JuliaLang?
// plain

Channels are a type of communication primitive in JuliaLang that allow for the exchange of messages between tasks. They are used to synchronize tasks and to pass data between them.

## Example code

```
# Create a channel
c = Channel()

# Send a message to the channel
@async put!(c, 42)

# Receive a message from the channel
x = take!(c)
println(x)
```

## Output example

```
42
```

## Code explanation


1. `c = Channel()`: This creates a channel which can be used to send and receive messages.

2. `put!(c, 42)`: This sends the message `42` to the channel `c`.

3. `x = take!(c)`: This receives a message from the channel `c` and stores it in the variable `x`.

4. `println(x)`: This prints the value of `x` to the console.
