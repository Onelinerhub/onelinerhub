# How to use the JuliaLang package manager?
// plain

The JuliaLang package manager is a powerful tool for managing packages and dependencies. It allows users to easily install, update, and remove packages.

To use the JuliaLang package manager, first open the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) by typing `julia` in the command line. Then, type `]` to enter the package manager mode.

## Example

```
julia
]
```

Once in the package manager mode, you can use the following commands to manage packages:

* `add`: adds a package to the current environment
* `update`: updates a package to the latest version
* `remove`: removes a package from the current environment
* `status`: shows the status of installed packages
* `precompile`: precompiles installed packages

For more information, please refer to the [JuliaLang documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/).
