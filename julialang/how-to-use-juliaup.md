# How to use JuliaUp?
// plain

JuliaUp is a package for Julia that allows you to quickly and easily upload files to the cloud. It supports a variety of cloud storage providers, including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure.

To use JuliaUp, you first need to install the package. You can do this by running the following command in the Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("JuliaUp")
```

Once the package is installed, you can use the `upload` function to upload a file to the cloud. For example, to upload a file named `myfile.txt` to Amazon S3, you can use the following code:

```julia
using JuliaUp
upload("myfile.txt", provider="S3")
```

The `upload` function takes two arguments: the file name and the cloud storage provider. It will then upload the file to the specified provider.

For more information on using JuliaUp, please refer to the [documentation](https://juliaup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
