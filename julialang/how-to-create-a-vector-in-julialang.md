# How to create a vector in JuliaLang?
// plain

Creating a vector in JuliaLang is easy. You can use the `[ ]` syntax to create a vector. For example:

```
julia> v = [1, 2, 3]
3-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
```

The code above creates a vector `v` with three elements: `1`, `2`, and `3`.

The code consists of two parts:
1. `v = [1, 2, 3]` - This part creates the vector `v` with the elements `1`, `2`, and `3`.
2. `julia> v` - This part prints the vector `v` to the console.

For more information about creating vectors in JuliaLang, see the [JuliaLang documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/arrays/#Creating-Arrays-1).
