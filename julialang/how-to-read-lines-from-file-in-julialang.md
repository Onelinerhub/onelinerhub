# How to read lines from file in JuliaLang?
// plain

Reading lines from a file in JuliaLang is a simple process. The following example code block reads a file line by line and prints each line to the console:

```
f = open("myfile.txt")
for line in eachline(f)
    println(line)
end
close(f)
```

The output of the code above would be the contents of the file `myfile.txt` printed to the console.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `f = open("myfile.txt")` - This opens the file `myfile.txt` and assigns it to the variable `f`.
2. `for line in eachline(f)` - This starts a loop that iterates over each line in the file `f`.
3. `println(line)` - This prints the current line to the console.
4. `end` - This ends the loop.
5. `close(f)` - This closes the file `f`.
