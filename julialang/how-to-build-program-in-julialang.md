# How to build program in JuliaLang?
// plain

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. To build a program in Julia, you need to:

1. Write the code in a text editor.
2. Save the code in a file with the extension `.jl`.
3. Run the code in the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) by typing `include("filename.jl")`

## Example code

```
# This is a simple program to print "Hello World!"
println("Hello World!")
```

## Output example

```
Hello World!
```

Detailed explanation:

1. `#` is used to denote a comment in Julia.
2. `println` is a function used to print a string to the console.
3. `"Hello World!"` is the string that is printed to the console.
