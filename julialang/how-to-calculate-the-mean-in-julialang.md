# How to calculate the mean in JuliaLang?
// plain

The mean of a set of numbers can be calculated in JuliaLang using the `mean()` function.

```julia
julia> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
julia> mean(x)
3.0
```

The `mean()` function takes a vector of numbers as an argument and returns the mean of the numbers.

## Code explanation


- `mean()`: the function used to calculate the mean
- `x`: the vector of numbers used as an argument for the `mean()` function
