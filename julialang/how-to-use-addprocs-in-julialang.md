# How to use addprocs in JuliaLang?
// plain

To use `addprocs` in JuliaLang, you need to first start a cluster of workers. This can be done with the `addprocs` function, which takes the number of workers to start as an argument.

```julia
addprocs(4)
```

This will start 4 workers, and the output will look like this:

```
julia> addprocs(4)
4-element Array{Int64,1}:
 2
 3
 4
 5
```

Once the workers are started, you can use the `@spawn` macro to run code on the workers. The syntax is `@spawn <expression>`, where `<expression>` is the code you want to run on the workers.

```julia
@spawn println("Hello from worker $(myid())!")
```

This will print out a message from each worker, like this:

```
Hello from worker 2!
Hello from worker 3!
Hello from worker 4!
Hello from worker 5!
```
