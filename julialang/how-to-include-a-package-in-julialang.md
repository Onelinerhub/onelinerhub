# How to include a package in JuliaLang?
// plain

In JuliaLang, packages can be included using the `using` keyword. For example, to include the `DataFrames` package, the following code can be used:
```julia
using DataFrames
```

The code above will load the `DataFrames` package into the current Julia session. This package provides a data structure for working with tabular data. It also provides a variety of functions for manipulating and transforming data.

## Code explanation


- `using`: This keyword is used to include a package in JuliaLang.
