# How to solve differential equations in JuliaLang?
// plain

JuliaLang is a powerful language for solving differential equations. It provides a wide range of numerical methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations.

For example, the following code block solves a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) using the ODE solver `DifferentialEquations.jl`:

```julia
using DifferentialEquations

f(u,p,t) = 1.01*u
u0 = 1/2
tspan = (0.0,1.0)
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan)
sol = solve(prob)
```

The output of the code is:

```
retcode: Success
Interpolation: specialized 4th order "free" interpolation, specialized 2nd order "free" stiffness-aware interpolation
t: 5-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.0
 0.09964258706516003
 0.3457024247583422
 0.6776921908052249
 1.0
u: 5-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.5
 0.552938681151017
 0.7089376245893467
 0.9913594502399238
 1.3728004409033037
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `using DifferentialEquations`: This imports the `DifferentialEquations.jl` package.
2. `f(u,p,t) = 1.01*u`: This defines the ODE to be solved.
3. `u0 = 1/2`: This sets the initial condition for the ODE.
4. `tspan = (0.0,1.0)`: This sets the time interval for the ODE.
5. `prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan)`: This creates an ODEProblem object.
6. `sol = solve(prob)`: This solves the ODEProblem object.
