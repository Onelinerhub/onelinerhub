# How to work with linear algebra in JuliaLang?
// plain

Linear algebra is a powerful tool for solving mathematical problems in JuliaLang. It can be used to solve systems of linear equations, calculate matrix operations, and perform other mathematical operations.

To work with linear algebra in JuliaLang, you can use the LinearAlgebra package. This package provides functions for solving linear equations, calculating matrix operations, and performing other linear algebra operations.

## Example code

```
using LinearAlgebra

A = [1 2; 3 4]
b = [5; 6]

x = A \ b

println(x)
```

## Output example

```
[-4.0; 4.5]
```

## Code explanation

- `using LinearAlgebra`: This imports the LinearAlgebra package, which provides functions for working with linear algebra in JuliaLang.
- `A = [1 2; 3 4]`: This creates a 2x2 matrix with the given values.
- `b = [5; 6]`: This creates a vector with the given values.
- `x = A \ b`: This solves the linear equation `Ax = b` for `x`.
- `println(x)`: This prints the solution to the console.
