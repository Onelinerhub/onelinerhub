# How can I use Python to interact with a MySQL database on YouTube?
// plain

Python can be used to interact with a MySQL database on YouTube using the [MySQL Connector/Python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/index.html) library. To do this, you must first install the library using pip:

```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

Once the library is installed, you can create a connection object to the database using the [connect()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-connectargs.html) function. This function requires several arguments such as the host address, username, password, and database name:

```
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)
```

Once the connection has been established, you can execute SQL queries using the [execute()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-api-mysqlcursor-execute.html) method. For example, to insert a row into the `users` table:

```
sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (%s, %s)"
val = ("John", 21)

mycursor.execute(sql, val)
```

The changes made to the database can be committed using the [commit()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-api-mysqlconnection-commit.html) method.

```
connection.commit()
```

Finally, when you are done interacting with the database, you can close the connection using the [close()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-api-mysqlconnection-close.html) method.

```
connection.close()
```

For more information, please refer to the [MySQL Connector/Python documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/index.html).
