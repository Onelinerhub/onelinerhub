# How do I set up a secure SSL connection between Python and MySQL?
// plain

To set up a secure SSL connection between Python and MySQL, you need to install the ```mysql-connector-python``` library and the ```PyMySQL``` library.

Then, you can use the following code to establish a secure SSL connection:

```
import mysql.connector
import pymysql

# Establish a secure SSL connection
db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='hostname',
    user='username',
    passwd='password',
    ssl_ca='/path/to/ca.pem',
    ssl_cert='/path/to/client-cert.pem',
    ssl_key='/path/to/client-key.pem'
)

# Establish a secure SSL connection
db_connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='hostname',
    user='username',
    passwd='password',
    ssl={
        'ca': '/path/to/ca.pem',
        'cert': '/path/to/client-cert.pem',
        'key': '/path/to/client-key.pem'
    }
)
```

This code will establish a secure SSL connection between Python and MySQL.

Parts of the code:

* `mysql.connector.connect`: Establishes a connection to the MySQL server.
* `host`: The hostname of the MySQL server.
* `user`: The username of the MySQL server.
* `passwd`: The password of the MySQL server.
* `ssl_ca`: The path to the root certificate of the server.
* `ssl_cert`: The path to the client certificate.
* `ssl_key`: The path to the client key.
