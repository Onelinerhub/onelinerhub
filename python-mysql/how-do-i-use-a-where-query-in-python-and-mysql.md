# How do I use a WHERE query in Python and MySQL?
// plain

A WHERE query in Python and MySQL is used to filter the results of a SQL query based on specific criteria.

The syntax of a WHERE query is as follows:
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

For example:
```
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany';
```

This query will select all columns from the Customers table where the Country is Germany.

The parts of the WHERE query are as follows:
- `SELECT`: specifies the columns to be returned by the query
- `FROM`: specifies the table to select data from
- `WHERE`: specifies the criteria for the selection
