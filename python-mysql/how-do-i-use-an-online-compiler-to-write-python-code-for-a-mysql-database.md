To use an online compiler to write Python code for a MySQL database, you will need to install the MySQL Connector/Python library. This library allows Python programs to access a MySQL database.

Once the library is installed, you can write Python code to connect to a MySQL database. For example:

```
import mysql.connector

# Connect to the database
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="user",
  passwd="password"
)

# Print the connection object
print(mydb)
```

This code will connect to the MySQL database using the host, user, and password provided. The output will be a connection object, such as:

```
<mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x7f2f7e3f7f90>
```

Once connected, you can use Python to perform operations on the database, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying data.

For example:

```
# Create a table
mycursor = mydb.cursor()
mycursor.execute("CREATE TABLE customers (name VARCHAR(255), address VARCHAR(255))")

# Insert data
sql = "INSERT INTO customers (name, address) VALUES (%s, %s)"
val = ("John", "Highway 21")
mycursor.execute(sql, val)

# Query the database
mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers")

# Print the results
myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

for x in myresult:
  print(x)
```

This code will create a table named "customers", insert the data "John" and "Highway 21" into the table, and query the table. The output will be the data that was inserted, such as:

```
('John', 'Highway 21')
```

For more information about using Python to access a MySQL database, see the [MySQL Connector/Python documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/).
