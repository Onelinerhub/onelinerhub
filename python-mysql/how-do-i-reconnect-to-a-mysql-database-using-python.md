# How do I reconnect to a MySQL database using Python?
// plain

To reconnect to a MySQL database using Python, you will need to use the [MySQL Connector/Python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/) library. This library provides an interface to connect to and interact with the MySQL database.

The following example code will connect to a MySQL database called `mydb` with the user `myuser` and password `mypass`:
```python
import mysql.connector

# Connect to the database
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="myuser",
  passwd="mypass",
  database="mydb"
)

print(mydb)
# Output: <mysql.connector.connection_cext.CMySQLConnection object at 0x7f8a6c2f8a90>
```

The code consists of the following parts:
- `import mysql.connector`: This line imports the MySQL Connector/Python library.
- `mydb = mysql.connector.connect()`: This line establishes the connection to the MySQL database with the given parameters.
- `host`: This is the hostname of the MySQL server.
- `user`: This is the username used to authenticate with the MySQL server.
- `passwd`: This is the password used to authenticate with the MySQL server.
- `database`: This is the name of the MySQL database to connect to.
- `print(mydb)`: This line prints out the connection object.

For more information, please refer to the [MySQL Connector/Python documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/).
