# How do I perform a MySQL health check using Python?
// plain

To perform a MySQL health check using Python, we can use the MySQL Connector/Python library. This library provides an API to connect to a MySQL database and execute commands.

Below is an example of how to connect to a MySQL database and run a query to check the health of the database:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Connect to the database
db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="user",
    passwd="password",
    database="mydatabase"
)

# Create a cursor
cursor = db.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute("SHOW GLOBAL STATUS")

# Fetch the results
result = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the results
print(result)
```

The output of the above code would be a list of tuples containing the status variables and their values.

The following parts are used in the example code:

1. `import mysql.connector`: This imports the MySQL Connector/Python library.
2. `db = mysql.connector.connect()`: This establishes a connection to the database.
3. `cursor = db.cursor()`: This creates a cursor object which can be used to execute queries.
4. `cursor.execute("SHOW GLOBAL STATUS")`: This executes the query to check the health of the database.
5. `result = cursor.fetchall()`: This fetches the results of the query.
6. `print(result)`: This prints the results.
