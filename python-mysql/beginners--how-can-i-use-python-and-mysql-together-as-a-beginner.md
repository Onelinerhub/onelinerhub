How can I use Python and MySQL together as a beginner?
// plain

Python and MySQL can be used together to create powerful applications. As a beginner, you can use the Python MySQL connector library to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries.

The following example code shows how to connect to a MySQL database and execute a simple query:

```
import mysql.connector

# Connect to the database
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="user",
  passwd="password"
)

# Create a cursor
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# Execute a query
mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable")

# Fetch the data
myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

# Print the data
print(myresult)
```

The output of the above code will be a list of tuples containing the data from the `mytable` table.
