# How can I keep a MySQL connection open in Python?
// plain

To keep a MySQL connection open in Python, you can use the `mysql-connector-python` library. This library allows you to establish a connection to a MySQL server and keep it open. Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Create connection
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="user",
  passwd="passwd"
)

# Keep connection open
mydb.ping(reconnect=True)
```

This code will create a connection to a MySQL server and keep it open. You can also use the `mysql-connector-python` library to perform queries and other operations on the MySQL server.

The code consists of the following parts:
1. `import mysql.connector`: This imports the `mysql.connector` library, which is used to connect to a MySQL server.
2. `mydb = mysql.connector.connect(host="localhost", user="user", passwd="passwd")`: This creates a connection to the MySQL server with the given host, user, and password.
3. `mydb.ping(reconnect=True)`: This keeps the connection open, and reconnects if the connection is lost.
