# How do I use the Python MySQL connector?
// plain

The Python MySQL connector is a library that allows Python to connect to and interact with a MySQL database. It provides an interface for Python to execute database operations such as creating, updating, and querying tables.

To use the Python MySQL connector, you must first install the library.

```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

Once the library is installed, you can create a connection to the MySQL database.

```
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="root",
  passwd=""
)
```

Then, you can use the connection to execute database operations. For example, to create a table:

```
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

mycursor.execute("CREATE TABLE customers (name VARCHAR(255), address VARCHAR(255))")
```

Finally, you can close the connection when you are finished.

```
mydb.close()
```
