# How can I use a MySQL variable in Python?
// plain

You can use a MySQL variable in Python by using the MySQL Connector/Python library. This library provides an API that allows you to connect to a MySQL database, execute queries, and retrieve results. You can use the library to create a connection to your MySQL database, and then use the connection to set and retrieve variables.

For example, the following code creates a connection to a MySQL database, sets a variable, and then retrieves the value of the variable:
```
import mysql.connector

# Create a connection to the MySQL database
db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="user",
    passwd="password",
    database="mydatabase"
)

# Set a variable in the database
cursor = db.cursor()
cursor.execute("SET @myvar = 'Hello World'")

# Retrieve the value of the variable
cursor.execute("SELECT @myvar")
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(result[0])
```
The output of this code will be:
```
Hello World
```

The code consists of the following parts:
1. Importing the MySQL Connector/Python library
2. Creating a connection to the MySQL database
3. Setting a variable in the database
4. Retrieving the value of the variable
5. Printing the value of the variable

For more information on using the MySQL Connector/Python library, please refer to the [MySQL Connector/Python documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/).
