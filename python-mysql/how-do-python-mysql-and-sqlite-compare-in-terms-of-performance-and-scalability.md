# How do Python MySQL and SQLite compare in terms of performance and scalability?
// plain

Python MySQL and SQLite are two popular relational database management systems. Both databases are open source and offer high performance and scalability.

Performance-wise, MySQL is the better choice for large-scale applications that require a high level of performance. MySQL is optimized for high-speed queries and can handle larger datasets more efficiently than SQLite.

Scalability-wise, MySQL is the better choice for applications that require a large amount of data or require a high level of scalability. MySQL is designed to scale up easily and can handle large amounts of data more efficiently than SQLite.

For example, the following code block shows how to connect to a MySQL database and execute a query:
```
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers")

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

for x in myresult:
  print(x)
```

The output of this code would be a list of all the records in the "customers" table.

In comparison, the following code block shows how to connect to a SQLite database and execute a query:
```
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')

c = conn.cursor()

c.execute("SELECT * FROM customers")

print(c.fetchall())

conn.close()
```

The output of this code would be a list of all the records in the "customers" table.

Overall, MySQL is the better choice for applications that require high performance and scalability, while SQLite is the better choice for applications that require a lightweight database.
