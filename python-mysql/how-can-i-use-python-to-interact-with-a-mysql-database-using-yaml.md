# How can I use Python to interact with a MySQL database using YAML?
// plain

Python can be used to interact with a MySQL database using YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) through the Python YAML module. YAML is a data serialization format designed to be human-readable and easily convertible to other data formats.

The following example code shows how to connect to a MySQL database using YAML:

```python
import yaml

# Load the YAML file containing the database connection information
with open('database.yaml') as f:
    db_config = yaml.load(f)

# Connect to the database
connection = mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)
```

## Code explanation


1. Import YAML module: `import yaml`
2. Load the YAML file containing the database connection information: `with open('database.yaml') as f: db_config = yaml.load(f)`
3. Connect to the database: `connection = mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)`
