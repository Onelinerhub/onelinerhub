# How can I use the MySQL Connector in Python?
// plain

MySQL Connector/Python is a standardized database driver for Python platforms and development. It allows you to connect to a MySQL database server from a Python program.

To use the MySQL Connector in Python, you need to install it using pip.

```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

Once installed, you can use the following code to connect to a MySQL database server:

```
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword"
)

print(mydb)
```

## Output example

```
<mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x7f8f9c3d1a90>
```

The code above contains the following parts:

1. `import mysql.connector`: imports the MySQL Connector/Python module.
2. `mydb = mysql.connector.connect()`: creates a connection to the MySQL server.
3. `host`, `user`, and `passwd`: provide the necessary credentials for connecting to the server.
4. `print(mydb)`: prints the connection object.

For more information about using MySQL Connector/Python, see the [official documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/).
