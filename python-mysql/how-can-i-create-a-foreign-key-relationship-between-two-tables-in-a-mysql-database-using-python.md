# How can I create a foreign key relationship between two tables in a MySQL database using Python?
// plain

Creating a foreign key relationship between two tables in a MySQL database using Python is a relatively straightforward process. The following example code will create a foreign key relationship between two tables, `table1` and `table2`.

```
# Create foreign key
cursor.execute("ALTER TABLE table1 ADD FOREIGN KEY (column1) REFERENCES table2 (column2);")
```

This code will create a foreign key between the `column1` of `table1` and the `column2` of `table2`.

The parts of this code are:

1. `ALTER TABLE` - This specifies that the command is to alter an existing table.
2. `table1` - This is the name of the table that will have the foreign key created.
3. `ADD FOREIGN KEY` - This specifies that the command is to add a foreign key.
4. `column1` - This is the name of the column in `table1` that will be the foreign key.
5. `REFERENCES` - This specifies that the foreign key is referencing another table.
6. `table2` - This is the name of the table that will be referenced by the foreign key.
7. `column2` - This is the name of the column in `table2` that will be referenced by the foreign key.
