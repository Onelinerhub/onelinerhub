# How can I use Python to update multiple rows in a MySQL database?
// plain

Using Python to update multiple rows in a MySQL database is very easy. First, you need to import the necessary modules, such as `MySQLdb` and `sys`.

```python
import MySQLdb
import sys
```

Then, you need to connect to the database and create a cursor object.

```python
db = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost", user="user", passwd="pass", db="database")
cursor = db.cursor()
```

Next, you need to create an SQL query that will update the data in the database.

```python
sql = "UPDATE table SET field1 = %s, field2 = %s WHERE condition"
```

Finally, you need to execute the query.

```python
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql, (value1, value2))
   # Commit your changes in the database
   db.commit()
except:
   # Rollback in case there is any error
   db.rollback()
```

Once the query has been executed, you can close the database connection.

```python
db.close()
```
