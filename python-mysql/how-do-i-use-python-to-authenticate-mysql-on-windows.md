# How do I use Python to authenticate MySQL on Windows?
// plain

Using Python to authenticate MySQL on Windows is simple and straightforward. To get started, you'll need to install the MySQL Connector/Python package. Once installed, you can use the following example code to connect to a MySQL database:

```
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword"
)

print(mydb)
```

The output of the above code should be a MySQL connection object.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import mysql.connector`: This imports the MySQL Connector/Python package.
2. `mydb = mysql.connector.connect(...)`: This creates a connection object to the MySQL database.
3. `host="localhost"`: This specifies the hostname of the MySQL server.
4. `user="yourusername"`: This specifies the username used to authenticate with the MySQL server.
5. `passwd="yourpassword"`: This specifies the password used to authenticate with the MySQL server.
6. `print(mydb)`: This prints the connection object to the console.

For more information, please see the [MySQL Connector/Python documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/).
