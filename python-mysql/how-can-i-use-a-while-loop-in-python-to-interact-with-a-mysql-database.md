# How can I use a while loop in Python to interact with a MySQL database?
// plain

Using a while loop in Python to interact with a MySQL database is a fairly common task. To do this, you will need to use the Python MySQL connector library. The following example code will demonstrate how to use a while loop to interact with a MySQL database:

```
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="user",
  passwd="passwd",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "SELECT * FROM customers"

mycursor.execute(sql)

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

while myresult != None:
  print(myresult)
  myresult = mycursor.fetchall()
```

This code will connect to a MySQL database, execute a SQL query to select all customers, and then use a while loop to iterate through the results and print them out.

## Code explanation


1. `import mysql.connector` - imports the Python MySQL connector library
2. `mydb = mysql.connector.connect(host="localhost", user="user", passwd="passwd", database="mydatabase")` - establishes a connection to the MySQL database
3. `mycursor = mydb.cursor()` - creates a cursor object to interact with the database
4. `sql = "SELECT * FROM customers"` - creates a SQL query to select all customers from the database
5. `mycursor.execute(sql)` - executes the SQL query
6. `myresult = mycursor.fetchall()` - fetches all the results from the query
7. `while myresult != None:` - creates a while loop to iterate through the results
8. `print(myresult)` - prints out the results
9. `myresult = mycursor.fetchall()` - fetches the next set of results
