# How do I troubleshoot a "Python MySQL Not Found" error?
// plain

When you encounter a "Python MySQL Not Found" error, it usually means that the MySQLdb library is not installed on your system. To troubleshoot this issue, you should first check if the library is installed. To do this, you can try running the following code:

```python
import MySQLdb
```

If the library is not installed, you will see an error message like this:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'MySQLdb'
```

If this is the case, you can install the library using the following command:

```
pip install mysqlclient
```

Once the library is installed, you can then try running the code again. If the library is installed correctly, you should not see any errors.

It's also important to make sure that you have the correct version of the library installed. You can check the version of the library with the following code:

```python
import MySQLdb

print(MySQLdb.__version__)
```

Which should output something like:

```
1.4.6
```

If you are still encountering the "Python MySQL Not Found" error, some other possible causes include:

- Incorrectly configured database credentials
- Incorrectly configured database connection settings
- Problems with the MySQL server
