# How do I create a connection pool for MySQL using Python?
// plain

Creating a connection pool for MySQL using Python is a simple process. First, we must import the necessary libraries. This includes `mysql.connector` and `mysql.connector.pooling`.

```python
import mysql.connector
import mysql.connector.pooling
```

Next, we will create the connection pool. This involves specifying the host, user, password, database, and pool size.

```python
pool = mysql.connector.pooling.MySQLConnectionPool(
    host="localhost",
    user="user",
    password="password",
    database="database",
    pool_size=3
)
```

Finally, we can use the connection pool to create and manage connections.

```python
connection = pool.get_connection()
```

This code will create a connection pool with a pool size of 3, and will create a connection to the database.
