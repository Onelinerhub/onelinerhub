# How can I use Python and MySQL together to perform asynchronous operations?
// plain

Python and MySQL can be used together to perform asynchronous operations by using the asyncio module. The asyncio module provides a set of functions that allow for asynchronous programming.

For example, the following code can be used to asynchronously execute a MySQL query:
```
import asyncio
import aiomysql

async def query_mysql():
    conn = await aiomysql.connect(host='localhost',
                                  user='user',
                                  password='password',
                                  db='dbname')
    cur = await conn.cursor()
    await cur.execute("SELECT * FROM table")
    print(cur.fetchall())
    conn.close()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(query_mysql())
```

The output of the above code would be all the rows in the table specified in the query.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import asyncio` and `import aiomysql`: imports the asyncio and aiomysql modules which are needed for asynchronous programming.
2. `async def query_mysql():`: defines a function that will execute the asynchronous query.
3. `conn = await aiomysql.connect(host='localhost', user='user', password='password', db='dbname')`: establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
4. `cur = await conn.cursor()`: creates a cursor object which is used to execute the query.
5. `await cur.execute("SELECT * FROM table")`: executes the query.
6. `print(cur.fetchall())`: prints the results of the query.
7. `conn.close()`: closes the connection to the MySQL database.
8. `loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()`: creates an event loop which is needed to run the asynchronous code.
9. `loop.run_until_complete(query_mysql())`: runs the asynchronous query.
