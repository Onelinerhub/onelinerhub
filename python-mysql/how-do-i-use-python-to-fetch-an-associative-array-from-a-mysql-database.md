# How do I use Python to fetch an associative array from a MySQL database?
// plain

To fetch an associative array from a MySQL database using Python, you need to use the Python MySQL Connector library. Here is an example of code that you can use:

```
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor(dictionary=True)

mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers")

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

for x in myresult:
  print(x)
```

The output of this code would be a list of associative arrays, each containing the data for a single customer from the customers table.

## Code explanation


1. `import mysql.connector`: This imports the MySQL Connector library.
2. `mydb = mysql.connector.connect(host="localhost", user="yourusername", passwd="yourpassword")`: This connects to the MySQL database using the specified username and password.
3. `mycursor = mydb.cursor(dictionary=True)`: This creates a cursor object with the dictionary flag set to True, which will return the results as an associative array.
4. `mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers")`: This executes the query on the database, which in this case is selecting all records from the customers table.
5. `myresult = mycursor.fetchall()`: This fetches all of the results from the query and stores them in the myresult variable.
6. `for x in myresult: print(x)`: This iterates through the myresult variable and prints out each result.
