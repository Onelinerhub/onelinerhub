# How do I connect to a MySQL database using XAMPP and Python?
// plain

To connect to a MySQL database using XAMPP and Python, you will need to create a connection object, using the `mysql.connector` module. The following example code will connect to a database named `mydatabase` on a localhost server:

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

print(mydb)
# Output: <mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x7f3a1cf2f3d0>
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import mysql.connector`: This imports the `mysql.connector` module, which is used to connect to a MySQL database.
2. `mydb = mysql.connector.connect()`: This creates a connection object, which is used to connect to the database.
3. `host="localhost"`: This specifies the hostname of the server, which in this case is `localhost`.
4. `user="yourusername"`: This specifies the username used to access the database.
5. `passwd="yourpassword"`: This specifies the password used to access the database.
6. `database="mydatabase"`: This specifies the name of the database to connect to.
7. `print(mydb)`: This prints the connection object, which indicates that the connection was successful.
