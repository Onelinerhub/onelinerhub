# How can I use a Python MySQL asynchronous driver?
// plain

To use a Python MySQL asynchronous driver, you first need to install the appropriate library, such as `aiomysql` for Python 3.5+.

```
pip install aiomysql
```

Once installed, you can connect to a MySQL database in an asynchronous manner with the following code.

```
import aiomysql

async def connect_mysql():
    conn = await aiomysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306,
                                  user='user', password='password',
                                  db='dbname', loop=loop)
    return conn
```

You can then use the connection to perform various operations such as executing queries, creating tables, and inserting/updating/deleting records. For example:

```
async def create_table(conn):
    async with conn.cursor() as cur:
        await cur.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name VARCHAR(255))")

async def insert_data(conn):
    async with conn.cursor() as cur:
        await cur.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'John')")
```

Once you have finished your operations, it is important to close the connection.

```
conn.close()
```
