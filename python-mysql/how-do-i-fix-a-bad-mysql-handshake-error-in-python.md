# How do I fix a bad MySQL handshake error in Python?
// plain

The most common cause of a bad MySQL handshake error in Python is that the client is not properly configured to connect to the server. To fix this issue, you need to make sure that your client is properly configured with the correct credentials.

Below is an example of how to configure your MySQL client in Python:

```
import mysql.connector

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    passwd="your_password"
)
```

The `host` parameter specifies the hostname or IP address of your MySQL server. The `user` and `passwd` parameters specify the username and password of your MySQL user.

Once your client is properly configured, you should be able to connect to the MySQL server without any errors.
