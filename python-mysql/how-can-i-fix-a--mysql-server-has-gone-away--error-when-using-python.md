# How can I fix a "MySQL server has gone away" error when using Python?
// plain

The "MySQL server has gone away" error is a common error encountered when using Python with MySQL. To fix this error, you can increase the "wait_timeout" value in the MySQL configuration file. This will allow the MySQL server to wait longer before timing out a connection.

For example, to increase the wait_timeout value to 300 seconds, you can add the following line to the MySQL configuration file:
```
wait_timeout = 300
```

You will also need to restart the MySQL server for the changes to take effect.

To further debug the issue, you can set the MySQL "interactive_timeout" and "connect_timeout" values to the same value as "wait_timeout". This will ensure that all timeouts are set to the same value.
