# How can I use Python to manage MySQL transactions?
// plain

Python can be used to manage MySQL transactions using the `MySQL Connector/Python` library. This library provides an interface for connecting to a MySQL database server and performing various operations. The following example code shows how to create a connection to a MySQL server and execute a transaction:

```
import mysql.connector

# Create a connection to the MySQL server
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="user",
    passwd="password",
    database="database"
)

# Create a cursor to execute queries
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Start a transaction
cursor.execute("START TRANSACTION")

# Execute a query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table")

# Commit the transaction
cursor.execute("COMMIT")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

The code above will connect to a MySQL server, create a cursor object, start a transaction, execute a query, commit the transaction, and close the connection.

## Code explanation


1. `import mysql.connector` - Imports the MySQL Connector/Python library.
2. `conn = mysql.connector.connect()` - Creates a connection to the MySQL server.
3. `cursor = conn.cursor()` - Creates a cursor object to execute queries.
4. `cursor.execute("START TRANSACTION")` - Starts a transaction.
5. `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table")` - Executes a query.
6. `cursor.execute("COMMIT")` - Commits the transaction.
7. `conn.close()` - Closes the connection.
