// plain

To count the number of records in a MySQL database using Python, you can use the `cursor.execute()` method of the `MySQLdb` library. This method takes in a SQL query as a parameter and returns the number of records in the database. The following example code block shows how to use this method to count the number of records in a table called `myTable`:

```python
import MySQLdb

# establish connection to MySQL database
db = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost", user="user", passwd="password", db="myDatabase")

# create a cursor object
cursor = db.cursor()

# execute a SQL query
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM myTable")

# get the number of records
numRecords = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# print the number of records
print(numRecords)
```

The output of the above code would be the number of records in the `myTable` table.

The code can be broken down as follows:

1. `import MySQLdb`: imports the `MySQLdb` library which provides access to MySQL databases.
2. `db = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost", user="user", passwd="password", db="myDatabase")`: establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
3. `cursor = db.cursor()`: creates a cursor object which is used to execute SQL queries.
4. `cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM myTable")`: executes a SQL query to count the number of records in the `myTable` table.
5. `numRecords = cursor.fetchone()[0]`: fetches the number of records from the result of the SQL query.
6. `print(numRecords)`: prints the number of records.
