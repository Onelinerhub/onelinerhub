# How can I establish a connection between Python and MySQL?
// plain

Establishing a connection between Python and MySQL can be done using the MySQL Connector/Python package. This package allows for Python to communicate with a MySQL database. Here is an example of a code block to connect to a MySQL database:

```
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="user",
  passwd="passwd"
)

print(mydb)
```

This code will output a MySQL connection object if the connection is successful.

The code is broken down as follows:
1. `import mysql.connector`: imports the MySQL Connector/Python package
2. `mydb = mysql.connector.connect(...)`: creates a connection object, `mydb`, using the `connect()` method
3. `host="localhost"`: specifies the host as `localhost`
4. `user="user"`: specifies the username
5. `passwd="passwd"`: specifies the password
6. `print(mydb)`: prints the MySQL connection object

For more information and examples of using the MySQL Connector/Python package, please refer to the [MySQL Connector/Python documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/).
