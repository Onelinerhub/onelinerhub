# How do I use Python to access MySQL binlogs?
// plain

To access MySQL binlogs using Python, you need to use the `mysql-replication` library. This library provides a Pythonic interface to access and analyze MySQL binary logs.

## Example code

```
from mysql_replication import BinLogStreamReader

stream = BinLogStreamReader(
        connection_settings = {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 3306,
            "user": "repl",
            "passwd": "slave"
        },
        server_id=100,
        blocking=True
    )

for binlogevent in stream:
    print(binlogevent)
```

This code will connect to the MySQL server and print out each binary log event as it is received.

Parts of the code:
- `mysql_replication`: the library used to access MySQL binary logs
- `BinLogStreamReader`: the class used to create a stream of binary log events
- `connection_settings`: a dictionary containing the MySQL server connection settings
- `server_id`: the unique server ID used to identify the server
- `blocking`: a boolean value indicating if the stream should block while waiting for new events
- `binlogevent`: an object containing the data from the binary log event
