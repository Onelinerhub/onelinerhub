How do I implement MySQL connection pooling in Python?
// plain

MySQL connection pooling in Python can be implemented using the `mysql-connector-python` library. This library provides the `MySQLConnectionPool` class which can be used to create a connection pool.

## Example code

```python
import mysql.connector

# Create a connection pool
mydb = mysql.connector.pooling.MySQLConnectionPool(
    pool_name="mypool",
    pool_size=3,
    host="localhost",
    user="user",
    passwd="password",
    database="mydatabase"
)

# Get a connection from the pool
connection = mydb.get_connection()
```

The code above creates a connection pool named "mypool" with a size of 3 connections, and connects to the MySQL server running on localhost.

The `get_connection()` method is used to get a connection from the pool. The connection can then be used to perform queries and other operations.

## Code explanation


1. `import mysql.connector`: imports the `mysql.connector` library which is used to create a connection pool.
2. `MySQLConnectionPool`: creates a connection pool with the specified parameters.
3. `pool_name`: the name of the connection pool.
4. `pool_size`: the maximum number of connections the pool can contain.
5. `host`: the hostname or IP address of the MySQL server.
6. `user`: the username used to connect to the MySQL server.
7. `passwd`: the password used to connect to the MySQL server.
8. `database`: the name of the database to connect to.
9. `get_connection()`: retrieves a connection from the pool.
