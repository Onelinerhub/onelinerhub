# How do I decide between using Python MySQL and PyMySQL?
// plain

The decision between using Python MySQL and PyMySQL depends on the specific requirements of your project.

Python MySQL is a library that allows you to access a MySQL database server from Python. It is written in C and can be used to access multiple databases. It provides support for most of the standard SQL language, as well as some advanced features.

PyMySQL is a pure-Python MySQL client library. It is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries. It supports most of the standard SQL language, as well as some advanced features.

The main difference between the two is that Python MySQL is written in C and PyMySQL is written in Python. Python MySQL is generally faster and more efficient, while PyMySQL is more lightweight and easier to use.

To decide between the two, consider the following factors:

* Performance: Python MySQL is generally faster and more efficient
* Ease of use: PyMySQL is more lightweight and easier to use
* Features: Both libraries support most of the standard SQL language, as well as some advanced features

For example, the following code connects to a MySQL database using Python MySQL:

```
import mysql.connector

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="user",
    passwd="password",
    database="my_database"
)
```

And the following code connects to a MySQL database using PyMySQL:

```
import pymysql

conn = pymysql.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="user",
    passwd="password",
    database="my_database"
)
```

In conclusion, the decision between using Python MySQL and PyMySQL depends on the specific requirements of your project. Consider the performance, ease of use, and features to decide which library is best for your project.
