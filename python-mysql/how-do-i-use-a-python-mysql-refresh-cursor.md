# How do I use a Python MySQL refresh cursor?
// plain

Using a cursor to refresh a MySQL table in Python is a relatively simple process.

First, you need to establish a connection to the database and create a cursor object. This can be done using the `mysql.connector` library.

```python
import mysql.connector

# Establish connection to the database
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="yourusername",
    passwd="yourpassword",
    database="yourdatabase"
)

# Create a cursor object
mycursor = mydb.cursor()
```

Once the connection is established and the cursor is created, you can execute the `refresh` command. This command will reload the table's content from the data file on disk.

```python
mycursor.execute("REFRESH TABLE yourtable")
```

The `refresh` command can also be used with additional parameters. For example, you can specify the `FORCE` flag to force the refresh even if the table is in use by another connection.

```python
mycursor.execute("REFRESH TABLE yourtable FORCE")
```

Finally, you should commit the changes to the database.

```python
mydb.commit()
```

For more information on the `refresh` command, see the [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/refresh.html).
