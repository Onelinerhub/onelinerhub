# How can I fix an "access denied" error when connecting to MySQL with Python?
// plain

To fix an "access denied" error when connecting to MySQL with Python, first check the login credentials you are using. Ensure that the username, password, and host are all correct. You can also try connecting with a different user if you have one.

Next, ensure that your user has the proper privileges to connect to the database. You can use the `GRANT` statement to grant privileges to the user.

If the issue persists, you can try connecting to the database with a different library. For example, you can use the `pymysql` library instead of the `mysqlclient` library.

## Example code

```
import pymysql

conn = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', user='username', password='password', db='mydb')

cursor = conn.cursor()
```

## Output example

```
<pymysql.cursors.Cursor object at 0x7f3f5f8d9c50>
```

The code above will:

1. Import the `pymysql` library.
2. Connect to the MySQL database using `conn = pymysql.connect()`.
3. Create a cursor object with `cursor = conn.cursor()`.
