# How can I retrieve a value from a MySQL database using Python?
// plain

To retrieve a value from a MySQL database using Python, you can use the MySQL Connector/Python library. The following example code will connect to a MySQL database, execute a query, and store the result in a variable:

```
import mysql.connector

# Connect to the database
db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="user",
    passwd="password",
    database="database_name"
)

# Create a cursor object
cursor = db.cursor()

# Execute a query
query = "SELECT * FROM table_name"
cursor.execute(query)

# Store the result in a variable
result = cursor.fetchone()
```

The `cursor.fetchone()` method will return the first row of the result set as a tuple, which can be stored in the `result` variable.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import mysql.connector`: This imports the MySQL Connector/Python library.
2. `db = mysql.connector.connect()`: This connects to the MySQL database using the specified credentials.
3. `cursor = db.cursor()`: This creates a cursor object which can be used to execute queries.
4. `query = "SELECT * FROM table_name"`: This defines the query which will be executed.
5. `cursor.execute(query)`: This executes the query.
6. `result = cursor.fetchone()`: This stores the first row of the result set in the `result` variable.
