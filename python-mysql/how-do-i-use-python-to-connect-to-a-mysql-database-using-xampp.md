# How do I use Python to connect to a MySQL database using XAMPP?
// plain

Using Python to connect to a MySQL database using XAMPP is easy. First, you need to install the Python MySQL connector module. This can be done using the command `pip install mysql-connector-python`.

Once the module is installed, you can use the following code to connect to the database.

```python
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="yourusername",
    passwd="yourpassword"
)

print(mydb)
```

The output of this code would be something like:
```
<mysql.connector.connection_cext.CMySQLConnection object at 0x7f7f4c3c4b50>
```

The code consists of the following parts:
1. `import mysql.connector`: This imports the `mysql.connector` module which is needed to connect to the database.
2. `mydb = mysql.connector.connect(...)`: This creates the connection object and stores it in the `mydb` variable. The parameters passed in the `connect()` method are the host, username and password of the database.
3. `print(mydb)`: This prints out the connection object.
