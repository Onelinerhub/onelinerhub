# How can I access MySQL using Python?
// plain

To access MySQL using Python, you can use a library called `mysql.connector`. This library allows you to connect to a MySQL database, execute SQL queries, and manage transactions.

## Example code

```
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword"
)

print(mydb)
```

## Output example

```
<mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection object at 0x7f7e5e2b3a90>
```

The code above consists of four parts:
1. `import mysql.connector`: This imports the `mysql.connector` library so that it can be used in the code.
2. `mydb = mysql.connector.connect`: This creates a connection object called `mydb` that is used to connect to the MySQL database.
3. `host="localhost"`, `user="yourusername"`, `passwd="yourpassword"`: These three parameters specify the connection details for the MySQL database. `host` is the address of the MySQL server, `user` is the username used to log in to the database, and `passwd` is the password used to log in to the database.
4. `print(mydb)`: This prints out the connection object `mydb` so that you can see if the connection was successful.

If the connection is successful, the output should be a `MySQLConnection` object.
