csvkit is a suite of command-line tools for converting to and working with CSV, the king of tabular file formats. To convert a tsv file to csv with csvkit, use the `in2csv` command.

## Example code

```
in2csv my_tsv_file.tsv > my_csv_file.csv
```

## Output example

```
my_csv_file.csv
```

The code consists of two parts:

1. `in2csv`: This is the command used to convert a tsv file to csv.

2. `my_tsv_file.tsv > my_csv_file.csv`: This is the file path of the tsv file to be converted, followed by the file path of the csv file to be created.
