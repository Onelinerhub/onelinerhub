# How to use triggers in MongoDB?
// plain

Triggers are a powerful feature of MongoDB that allow you to execute custom code when certain events occur. Triggers can be used to perform tasks such as validating data, sending notifications, or updating other collections.

## Example code

```
db.createTrigger({
  name: "validate_data",
  events: [
    {
      event: "insert",
      collection: "users",
      database: "my_db"
    }
  ],
  action: function(event) {
    // Validate data
  }
})
```

This example creates a trigger called "validate_data" that will be executed whenever a new document is inserted into the "users" collection in the "my_db" database. The action function contains the code that will be executed when the trigger is fired.
