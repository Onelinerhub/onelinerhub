# Example of a MongoDB connection string
// plain

An example of a MongoDB connection string is:

```
mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]
```

This connection string is used to connect to a MongoDB database. It consists of the following parts:

- `mongodb://`: This is the protocol used to connect to the MongoDB server.
- `[username:password@]`: This is an optional part of the connection string, which is used to specify the username and password for authentication.
- `host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]]`: This is the list of hosts and ports used to connect to the MongoDB server.
- `[/[database][?options]]`: This is an optional part of the connection string, which is used to specify the database name and connection options.

For more information, please refer to the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/).
