# How can I use Google Big Query with PHP?
// plain

Google Big Query is a powerful tool for querying large datasets. It can be used with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to store and query data. With the Big Query API, it is possible to access and manipulate data stored in Big Query from within PHP applications.

The following example code shows how to use the Big Query API to query a table in Big Query using PHP:

```php
<?php

// Include the Big Query API library
require_once 'google/apiclient/src/Google/autoload.php';

// Create a Big Query object
$bigQuery = new Google_Service_Bigquery($client);

// Set the query string
$queryString = "SELECT * FROM [my_dataset.my_table]";

// Run the query
$queryResults = $bigQuery->jobs->query($queryString);

// Print out the query results
print_r($queryResults);

?>
```

This code will query the table `my_dataset.my_table` from Big Query and print out the query results.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Include the Big Query API library: This line includes the Big Query API library in the PHP script.
2. Create a Big Query object: This line creates a Big Query object which is used to access the Big Query API.
3. Set the query string: This line sets the query string which will be used to query the Big Query table.
4. Run the query: This line runs the query and stores the results in the `$queryResults` variable.
5. Print out the query results: This line prints out the query results stored in the `$queryResults` variable.
