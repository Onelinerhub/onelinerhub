# How can I use Google Big Query with Grafana to visualize data?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse that can be used to store and query large datasets. With Grafana, a powerful open source analytics and visualization platform, you can visualize your BigQuery data in a variety of ways.

To use BigQuery with Grafana, you will need to install the BigQuery data source plugin. Once installed, you can create a BigQuery data source in Grafana and configure it to connect to your BigQuery instance.

Once the data source is configured, you can create a query to retrieve the data you want to visualize. For example, the following query retrieves the total number of users by day from a BigQuery table:

```
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp_column) AS date,
  COUNT(*) AS users
FROM
  table
GROUP BY
  date
```

Once the query is defined, you can use Grafana to create visualizations such as line graphs, bar charts, and heatmaps.

## Code explanation


- `SELECT` - defines the columns of data to be retrieved from the table
- `DATE()` - extracts the date from the timestamp column
- `COUNT(*)` - counts the number of rows in the table
- `FROM` - specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved
- `GROUP BY` - groups the data by the specified column
