# How do I set the Google Big Query key file path?
// plain

Setting the Google Big Query key file path is necessary for authenticating to the Big Query API. You will need to create a service account in the Google Cloud Platform Console and download the JSON key file associated with the service account.

Once you have downloaded the JSON key file, you can set the file path to the key file in the code. For example, in Python:

```
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Set the path to the key file
key_file_path = 'path/to/key_file.json'

# Create a credentials object from the key file
credentials = bigquery.Credentials.from_service_account_file(key_file_path)

# Create a BigQuery client with the credentials
client = bigquery.Client(credentials=credentials)
```

In the example code, `key_file_path` is set to the path to the JSON key file. The `bigquery.Credentials.from_service_account_file()` method is used to create a credentials object from the key file. Finally, the credentials object is used to create a BigQuery client.
