# How do I use Google Big Query with Python?
// plain

To use Google Big Query with Python, you need to install the BigQuery client library for Python. You can do this by running the command ```pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery``` in your terminal.

Once the library is installed, you can connect to BigQuery with the following code:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Construct a BigQuery client object.
client = bigquery.Client()
```

You can then use the client to query BigQuery. For example, to run a query to get the total number of records in a table, you can use the following code:

```python
# Construct a reference to the "my_dataset" dataset
dataset_ref = client.dataset("my_dataset")

# API request - fetch the dataset
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)

# Construct a reference to the "my_table" table
table_ref = dataset_ref.table("my_table")

# API request - fetch the table
table = client.get_table(table_ref)

# Print the number of rows in the table
print(table.num_rows)
```

The output of this code will be the number of records in the table.

The BigQuery client library for Python also offers many other operations and features, such as streaming data, loading data from a file, and querying with parameters. For more detailed information about how to use the BigQuery client library for Python, see the [documentation](https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/index.html).
