Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse that can help you achieve your goals. It is a serverless, fully managed, data warehousing solution that allows you to store and query large amounts of data quickly and easily.

The following example code block shows how to use Google BigQuery to query a table:

```
SELECT *
FROM `my-project.my-dataset.my-table`
```

This code will return all records from the table `my-table` located in the dataset `my-dataset` in the project `my-project`.

## Code explanation
