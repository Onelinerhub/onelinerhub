2. **Speed** - BigQuery can quickly process large amounts of data and provide results in seconds.
3. **Cost-Effective** - BigQuery is cost-effective as it only charges for the data you query.
4. **Integration** - BigQuery integrates with other Google Cloud services for data storage, machine learning, analytics, and more.

### Disadvantages
1. **Cost** - BigQuery can be expensive if you query large amounts of data.
2. **Limitations** - BigQuery has some limitations on the types of queries it can execute.
3. **Learning Curve** - BigQuery has a steep learning curve, and it can take time to get up to speed.
