# How do Google BigQuery and Azure compare in terms of performance and cost?
// plain

Google BigQuery and Azure offer similar performance and cost options, but there are some key differences.

Google BigQuery is a serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective cloud data warehouse. It offers high performance for complex queries, and is designed to scale up to thousands of concurrent users. BigQuery also offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which allows users to pay only for the data they store and query.

Azure offers a range of data warehouse solutions, including Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and Azure Data Lake Storage. Azure Synapse Analytics is a fully managed data warehouse that offers high performance and scalability. It also offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which allows users to pay only for the data they store and query.

In terms of performance, both BigQuery and Azure are designed for large-scale data processing and analytics. BigQuery offers a serverless architecture, which makes it easier to scale up to thousands of concurrent users. Azure offers a range of data warehouse solutions, including Azure Synapse Analytics, which is designed for high performance and scalability.

In terms of cost, both BigQuery and Azure offer a pay-as-you-go pricing model. This allows users to pay only for the data they store and query. Additionally, BigQuery offers an additional cost-saving feature, in which users can purchase discounted long-term storage for their data.

## Example code


```
SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE date_field > CURRENT_DATE()
```

## Output example


```
id  name      date_field
1   John      2020-09-10
2   Jane      2020-09-11
3   Bob       2020-09-12
```

## Code explanation


1. `SELECT *` - This is the command used to select all data from a table.
2. `FROM my_table` - This is the command used to specify which table the data should be retrieved from.
3. `WHERE date_field > CURRENT_DATE()` - This is the command used to specify the criteria for which data should be retrieved. In this example, only data with a date field greater than the current date will be retrieved.
