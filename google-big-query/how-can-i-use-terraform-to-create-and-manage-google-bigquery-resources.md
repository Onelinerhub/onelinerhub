# How can I use Terraform to create and manage Google BigQuery resources?
// plain

You can use Terraform to create and manage Google BigQuery resources by writing configuration files in Terraform's HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language).

For example, to create a BigQuery dataset, you could use the following code block:

```
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "my_dataset" {
  dataset_id = "my_dataset"
}
```

This will create a BigQuery dataset called `my_dataset`.

You can also use Terraform to manage BigQuery resources such as tables, views, jobs, and transfers. For example, to create a BigQuery table, you could use the following code block:

```
resource "google_bigquery_table" "my_table" {
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.my_dataset.dataset_id
  table_id   = "my_table"
}
```

This will create a BigQuery table called `my_table` in the `my_dataset` dataset.

You can also use Terraform to manage BigQuery IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies. For example, to grant a user access to a BigQuery dataset, you could use the following code block:

```
resource "google_bigquery_dataset_iam_member" "my_member" {
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.my_dataset.dataset_id
  member     = "user:example@example.com"
  role       = "roles/bigquery.dataViewer"
}
```

This will grant the user `example@example.com` the `bigquery.dataViewer` role on the `my_dataset` dataset.

For more information about using Terraform to manage Google BigQuery resources, see the [Google BigQuery Provider Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/bigquery_dataset.html).
