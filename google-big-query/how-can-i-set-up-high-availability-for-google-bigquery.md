# How can I set up high availability for Google BigQuery?
// plain

High availability for Google BigQuery can be set up with the following steps:

1. Create a regional or multi-regional Cloud Storage bucket to store your query results.

2. Create a BigQuery job to store query results in the Cloud Storage bucket.

```
bq query --destination_table=<project>.<dataset>.<table> --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT * FROM <table>'
```

3. Configure the BigQuery job to run periodically.

```
bq query --destination_table=<project>.<dataset>.<table> --use_legacy_sql=false --schedule='every 24 hours' 'SELECT * FROM <table>'
```

4. Create a Cloud Function to monitor the Cloud Storage bucket for new query results.

```
def monitor_bucket(data, context):
    # Check for new query results
    # Process query results
```

5. Create a Cloud Scheduler to trigger the Cloud Function periodically.

```
gcloud scheduler jobs create http <job-name> --schedule="0 0 * * *" --uri=<cloud-function-url>
```

6. Monitor the Cloud Function logs to ensure the query results are processed correctly.

7. Monitor the BigQuery job to ensure it is running as expected.
