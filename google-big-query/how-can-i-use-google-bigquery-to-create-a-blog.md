# How can I use Google BigQuery to create a blog?
// plain

Google BigQuery can be used to create a blog in several ways.

1. Use the BigQuery command-line tool to create a blog table. For example, the following code will create a blog table called `blog_posts`:
```
bq mk --table blog_posts
```

2. Use the BigQuery web UI to add columns to the blog table. For example, the following code will add a column called `title` to the `blog_posts` table:
```
bq update blog_posts add title:string
```

3. Use the BigQuery command-line tool to insert data into the blog table. For example, the following code will insert a row into the `blog_posts` table with the title “My First Blog Post”:
```
bq insert blog_posts title:"My First Blog Post"
```

4. Use the BigQuery web UI to query the blog table. For example, the following code will query the `blog_posts` table for all posts with the title “My First Blog Post”:
```
SELECT * FROM blog_posts WHERE title = "My First Blog Post"
```

5. Use the BigQuery command-line tool to delete data from the blog table. For example, the following code will delete the row with the title “My First Blog Post” from the `blog_posts` table:
```
bq delete blog_posts WHERE title = "My First Blog Post"
```

6. Use the BigQuery web UI to visualize the data in the blog table.

7. Use the BigQuery API to access the blog data programmatically.
