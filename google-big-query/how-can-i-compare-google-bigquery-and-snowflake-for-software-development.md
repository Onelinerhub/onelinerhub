# How can I compare Google BigQuery and Snowflake for software development?
// plain

Google BigQuery and Snowflake are two popular cloud-based data warehouses that are used for software development.

Google BigQuery is a managed, serverless data warehouse that can be used to store and analyze large datasets. It is easy to use and integrates well with other Google Cloud services. BigQuery provides a SQL-like query language for querying data and supports a wide range of data formats.

Snowflake is a fully managed cloud-based data warehouse that supports a wide range of data types and formats. It provides the ability to scale compute and storage independently, allowing for faster query execution times and lower costs. Snowflake also provides a SQL-like query language for querying data.

When comparing Google BigQuery and Snowflake for software development, the main differences are in scalability, cost, and performance. BigQuery is more cost-effective for smaller datasets, but Snowflake offers better scalability and performance for larger datasets.

Example code block:

```
SELECT *
FROM my_dataset.my_table
WHERE date > '2020-01-01'
```

## Code explanation


1. `SELECT *`: This statement is used to select all columns from the table.
2. `FROM my_dataset.my_table`: This statement specifies the dataset and table from which the data should be selected.
3. `WHERE date > '2020-01-01'`: This statement is used to filter the data by date.
