# How do I use Google BigQuery to analyze IP addresses?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based analytics tool. It can be used to analyze IP addresses by querying a database of IP address data.

For example, the following code can be used to query the IP address data from the MaxMind GeoLite2 database:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.maxmind_geolite2.ipv4_blocks`
WHERE network LIKE '123.45.67.%'
```

This query will return data for all IP addresses that match the specified network (in this example, all IP addresses beginning with `123.45.67.`).

The output of this query will include the following columns:
* `network` - the IP address range
* `geoname_id` - the GeoName ID of the geographic location associated with this IP address range
* `registered_country_geoname_id` - the GeoName ID of the country associated with this IP address range
* `represented_country_geoname_id` - the GeoName ID of the country associated with this IP address range
* `is_anonymous_proxy` - whether this IP address is associated with an anonymous proxy
* `is_satellite_provider` - whether this IP address is associated with a satellite provider

Using this data, it is possible to analyze the geographic location, country, and other attributes associated with a given IP address.
