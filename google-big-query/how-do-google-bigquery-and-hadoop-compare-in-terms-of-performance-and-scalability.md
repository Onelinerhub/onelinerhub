# How do Google BigQuery and Hadoop compare in terms of performance and scalability?
// plain

Google BigQuery and Hadoop both offer scalability and performance benefits. BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse solution that is highly optimized for large-scale analytics and data processing tasks. Hadoop is an open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.

BigQuery is generally faster than Hadoop in terms of performance, allowing for near real-time query results. BigQuery also makes it easier to scale up and down quickly and efficiently, as it is a cloud-based solution. Hadoop, on the other hand, requires more manual effort to scale up and down, as it is an on-premise solution.

For example, the following code block shows how to query data stored in BigQuery:
```
SELECT *
FROM my_dataset.my_table
WHERE condition
```
The output of the query would be the data that meets the condition in the query.

In comparison, Hadoop requires more manual work to query data. For example, the following code block shows how to query data stored in Hadoop:
```
hadoop fs -cat /data/my_data.csv | grep <condition>
```
The output of the query would be the data that meets the condition in the query.

Overall, BigQuery is better suited for large-scale analytics and data processing tasks, as it is faster and easier to scale. Hadoop is better suited for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
