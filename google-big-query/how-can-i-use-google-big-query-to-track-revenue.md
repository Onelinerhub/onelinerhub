# How can I use Google Big Query to track revenue?
// plain

Google BigQuery can be used to track revenue. To do this, you need to create a query that will aggregate data from the tables containing the revenue information. The following is an example query that will calculate the total revenue from a table containing sales data:

```
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM `mydataset.sales`
```

This query will return the total revenue from the `sales` table in the `mydataset` dataset.

You can also use BigQuery to track revenue over time. For example, the following query will calculate the total revenue for each month in the `sales` table:

```
SELECT DATE_TRUNC(month, sale_date) AS month, SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM `mydataset.sales`
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month
```

This query will return the total revenue for each month in the `sales` table.

## Code explanation


- `SELECT`: This clause is used to specify the columns to be returned in the query result.
- `SUM()`: This function is used to calculate the total revenue from the `amount` column in the `sales` table.
- `DATE_TRUNC()`: This function is used to truncate the `sale_date` column to the month level.
- `GROUP BY`: This clause is used to group the results by the specified column (in this case, `month`).
- `ORDER BY`: This clause is used to order the results by the specified column (in this case, `month`).
