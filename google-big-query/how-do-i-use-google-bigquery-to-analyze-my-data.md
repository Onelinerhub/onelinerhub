# How do I use Google BigQuery to analyze my data?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse that enables users to store and query large datasets. BigQuery can be used to analyze data using SQL queries.

Below is an example of a simple query that can be used to analyze data stored in BigQuery:

```
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  `mydataset.mytable`
```

This query will return the number of rows in the table `mytable` in the dataset `mydataset`.

## Code explanation

1. `SELECT` - This is the keyword used to start the query.
2. `COUNT(*)` - This is a function used to count the number of rows in the table.
3. `FROM` - This is the keyword used to specify the table.
4. `mydataset.mytable` - This is the name of the table in the dataset.
