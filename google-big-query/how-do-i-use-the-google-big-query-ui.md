# How do I use the Google Big Query UI?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse that allows users to store and query large datasets. To use the Google BigQuery UI, you must first create a project in the Google Cloud Console. Once your project is created, you can access the BigQuery UI by selecting the BigQuery icon from the left-hand navigation menu.

Once you are in the BigQuery UI, you can create a new dataset or query an existing dataset. For example, to create a new dataset, you can use the following code:

```
CREATE DATASET my_dataset;
```

This will create a new dataset with the name `my_dataset`.

You can also query an existing dataset by using the `SELECT` statement. For example, to query all the records from the `my_dataset` dataset, you can use the following code:

```
SELECT * FROM my_dataset;
```

This will return all the records from the `my_dataset` dataset.

In addition to creating and querying datasets, the BigQuery UI also allows users to view job history and manage access control.
