# How can I use Google BigQuery to answer specific questions?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective cloud data warehouse that can be used to answer specific questions. It allows users to query large datasets stored in the cloud using SQL-like language called BigQuery SQL.

For example, to answer the question "What is the total number of orders placed this month?", the following query can be used:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
WHERE DATE(order_date) >= DATE('2020-07-01')
AND DATE(order_date) < DATE('2020-08-01')
```

## Output example

```
total_orders
2345
```

The query consists of the following parts:

* `SELECT`: This clause is used to specify the columns to be returned by the query. In this example, `COUNT(*)` is used to count the total number of orders.
* `FROM`: This clause is used to specify the table from which the data should be retrieved. In this example, the `orders` table is used.
* `WHERE`: This clause is used to specify the criteria used to filter the data. In this example, the `DATE()` function is used to filter the orders based on the `order_date` column.
