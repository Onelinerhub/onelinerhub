# How do I use Google BigQuery to design an efficient data architecture?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful data warehousing service that enables users to design, store, and analyze large datasets. To design an efficient data architecture using BigQuery, one should follow the following steps:

1. Define the purpose of the data architecture.
2. Identify the data sources and types.
3. Design the schema of the data warehouse.
4. Create the tables in the data warehouse.

## Example code

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mydataset.mytable (
  id INT64,
  name STRING
)
```

## Output example

Table `mydataset.mytable` successfully created.

The code snippet above creates a table called `mytable` in the dataset `mydataset`. The table has two columns, `id` and `name`, both of which are of type `INT64` and `STRING` respectively.

Finally, to optimize the performance of the data architecture, one should use the BigQuery query optimization techniques such as partitioning, clustering, and caching.
