# How can I use Google Big Query to perform ETL operations?
// plain

Google Big Query is a serverless, fully managed data warehouse that can be used to store and query data. It can also be used to perform ETL operations. ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load, and is the process of extracting data from a source system, transforming it into a format that is suitable for analysis, and then loading it into a destination system.

For example, the following code can be used to extract data from a CSV file, transform it into a BigQuery table, and then load it into a BigQuery dataset:

```
bq load --source_format=CSV mydataset.mytable gs://mybucket/mydata.csv
```

This command will create a BigQuery table called `mytable` in the `mydataset` dataset. The table will be populated with the data from the CSV file `mydata.csv` stored in the Google Cloud Storage bucket `mybucket`.

## Code explanation


* `bq`: The command-line tool for BigQuery.
* `load`: The command to load data into BigQuery.
* `--source_format=CSV`: The format of the source data (in this case, a CSV file).
* `mydataset.mytable`: The name of the BigQuery table to create.
* `gs://mybucket/mydata.csv`: The location of the source data (in this case, a CSV file stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket).
