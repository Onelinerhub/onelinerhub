# How do I use the features of Google Big Query?

Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse that enables users to store and analyze massive amounts of data. It is a fully managed, serverless, and cost-effective analytics platform that enables users to quickly query data using standard SQL.

Using BigQuery features is easy. Here is an example of how to query a table using the BigQuery command line tool:

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT * FROM `myproject.mydataset.mytable`'
```

This will return the contents of the table in the form of a table.

To get more detailed information about the table, you can use the `DESCRIBE` command:

```
bq describe myproject.mydataset.mytable
```

This will return information about the table, such as the column names, data types, and the number of rows in the table.

You can also use BigQuery to create new tables from existing data. To do this, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` command:

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'CREATE TABLE myproject.mydataset.mynewtable AS SELECT * FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable'
```

This will create a new table with the same schema as the original table.

BigQuery also supports streaming data into tables. To do this, you can use the `INSERT INTO` command:

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'INSERT INTO myproject.mydataset.mytable VALUES (1, "foo", "bar")'
```

This will insert a single row into the table.

BigQuery also supports creating views, which are virtual tables that are based on the results of a query. To do this, you can use the `CREATE VIEW` command:

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'CREATE VIEW myproject.mydataset.myview AS SELECT * FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable WHERE col1 = "foo"'
```

This will create a view based on the results of the query.

These are just a few of the features of Google BigQuery. For more information, please refer to the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs).
