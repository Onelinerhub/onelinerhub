# How can I compare Google BigQuery and Amazon Redshift for software development?
// plain

Google BigQuery and Amazon Redshift are two popular cloud-based data warehouses. Both provide powerful tools for software development, but there are some key differences between them.

##### Example Code
```
SELECT *
FROM [table_name]
WHERE [condition]
```

##### Explanation
This code will select all rows from the table_name table where the condition is true.

##### Differences
- BigQuery is a serverless, fully managed data warehouse that can scale up or down on demand, while Redshift is a managed data warehouse that needs to be configured and provisioned.
- BigQuery is based on an SQL-like language called BigQuery SQL, while Redshift is based on PostgreSQL.
- BigQuery is designed to handle large datasets quickly and efficiently, while Redshift is better suited for smaller datasets.
- BigQuery is more expensive than Redshift, but it is also more powerful and easier to use.
