# How can I use Google BigQuery to query a MySQL database?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse service that allows users to query a MySQL database. To use BigQuery to query a MySQL database, you will need to first export the MySQL data into a BigQuery table. This can be done using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, which allows you to schedule periodic data imports from your MySQL database into BigQuery.

Once the MySQL data is in BigQuery, you can query it using standard SQL syntax. For example, the following code block will query a MySQL table called "my_table" and return all records where the "status" field is equal to "active":

```
SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE status = 'active'
```

The output of this query will be a table containing all records where the "status" field is equal to "active".

The code block above consists of three parts:
1. The SELECT statement, which specifies the columns to be returned.
2. The FROM statement, which specifies the table to query.
3. The WHERE statement, which specifies the condition to filter the query results.
