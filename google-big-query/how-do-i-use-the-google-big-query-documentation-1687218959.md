// plain

To use the Google Big Query documentation, first navigate to the [Big Query Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/). From there, you can find detailed information on all aspects of Big Query, from getting started to advanced topics.

For example, to get started, you can read the [Quickstart guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts). This guide will walk you through setting up a Big Query project, loading data, and running queries.

You can also read the [Big Query API reference](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/) for detailed information on the Big Query API. This reference contains information on how to use the API to create, manage, and query datasets.

You can also find code samples in the [Big Query samples repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-samples). These samples are organized by language and demonstrate how to use the Big Query API to work with data.

Once you have an understanding of the Big Query API, you can use the [Big Query Command Line Tool](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool) to interact with Big Query from the command line. This tool allows you to run queries, load data, and manage datasets.

For example, you can use the `bq query` command to run a query:
```
$ bq query 'SELECT * FROM [mydataset.mytable]'
```

This will return the results of the query:
```
+-------+--------+
|  name |  age   |
+-------+--------+
| Alice |   20   |
|  Bob  |   25   |
+-------+--------+
```

By using the Google Big Query documentation, you can learn how to use Big Query to store, manage, and query data.
