# How do I use Google BigQuery keys?
// plain

Google BigQuery Keys are used to securely access and manage data stored in BigQuery.

The keys are used to authenticate your identity and authorize access to BigQuery resources. They are also used to encrypt data stored in BigQuery.

Below is an example of how to use a BigQuery key. This example uses the BigQuery Python client library.

```
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Create a BigQuery client
client = bigquery.Client.from_service_account_json('path/to/key.json')

# List the datasets in the current project
datasets = list(client.list_datasets())

# Print the datasets
for dataset in datasets:
    print(dataset.dataset_id)
```

## Output example


```
my_dataset_1
my_dataset_2
```

The code does the following:

1. Imports the BigQuery Python client library.
2. Creates a BigQuery client using the BigQuery key.
3. Lists all datasets in the current project.
4. Prints the datasets.

For more information on using BigQuery keys, see the [BigQuery Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/).
