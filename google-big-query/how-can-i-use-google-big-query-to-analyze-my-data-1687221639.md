# How can I use Google Big Query to analyze my data?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful tool for analyzing large datasets. To use it, you need to first upload your data into BigQuery. You can do this using the BigQuery API, the BigQuery web UI, or the command-line tool. Once your data is in BigQuery, you can use SQL queries to analyze it.

For example, the following query can be used to count the number of records in a table:

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM [mydataset.mytable]
```

This query will return the number of records in the table `mydataset.mytable`.

You can also use BigQuery to perform more complex analysis. For example, the following query can be used to find the average salary for employees in a particular department:

```
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM [mydataset.employees]
WHERE department = 'Marketing'
```

This query will return the average salary for employees in the Marketing department.

You can also use BigQuery to perform statistical analysis, including aggregations, correlations, and regressions. For example, the following query can be used to find the correlation between two columns:

```
SELECT CORR(column1, column2)
FROM [mydataset.mytable]
```

This query will return the correlation between column1 and column2.

You can find more information about using BigQuery to analyze data in the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/).
