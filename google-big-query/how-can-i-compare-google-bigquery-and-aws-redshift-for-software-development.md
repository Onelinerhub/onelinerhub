# How can I compare Google BigQuery and AWS Redshift for software development?
// plain

Google BigQuery and AWS Redshift are both cloud-based data warehouses that can be used for software development. BigQuery is a serverless, fully managed data warehouse that offers an open source SQL-like query language. Redshift is a managed data warehouse service that offers a PostgreSQL-compatible interface.

When comparing the two services, BigQuery is generally more cost-effective, as it does not require any upfront costs and charges by the amount of data stored and queried. Redshift, on the other hand, requires upfront costs and charges by the amount of data stored and the number of nodes used.

BigQuery also supports a wide range of data types including nested and repeated fields, while Redshift does not. BigQuery also has a larger query size limit than Redshift.

In terms of performance, BigQuery is generally faster than Redshift, as it is a serverless solution and does not require nodes to be provisioned.

Example code to query data from BigQuery:

```
SELECT * FROM `project-id.dataset.table`
```

This code will query all data from the specified table in the dataset.
