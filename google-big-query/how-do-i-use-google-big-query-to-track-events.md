# How do I use Google Big Query to track events?
// plain

Google Big Query is a serverless, highly scalable enterprise data warehouse that enables organizations to analyze data quickly and cost-effectively. It can be used to track events by using the BigQuery streaming API. This API allows you to stream inserts, updates, and deletes of data in BigQuery tables in near real-time.

Below is an example of how to track events using BigQuery streaming API.

```
// Create a BigQuery client
BigQuery bigquery = BigQueryOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService();

// Create a table reference
TableId tableId = TableId.of("my_dataset", "my_table");

// Create a streaming buffer
TableDataWriteChannel writer =
    bigquery.writer(tableId);

// Write rows to the buffer
try (JsonWriter jsonWriter =
    JsonWriter.of(writer)) {
  jsonWriter.write(
    ImmutableMap.of(
        "event_name", "my_event",
        "event_timestamp", System.currentTimeMillis()));
}

// Flush the buffer to BigQuery
writer.close();
```

The code above will write a single row containing an event name and timestamp to the BigQuery table. This will allow you to track events in near real-time.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Creating a BigQuery client - This is the first step in using the BigQuery streaming API. It allows you to access the BigQuery service.
2. Creating a table reference - This is the reference to the BigQuery table that you want to write the data to.
3. Creating a streaming buffer - This is the buffer that will store the data before it is written to the table.
4. Writing rows to the buffer - This is where you write the data to the buffer. In this example, a single row containing an event name and timestamp is written.
5. Flushing the buffer to BigQuery - This is where the data is written from the buffer to the BigQuery table.
