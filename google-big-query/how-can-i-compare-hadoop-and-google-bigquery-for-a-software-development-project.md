# How can I compare Hadoop and Google BigQuery for a software development project?
// plain

Hadoop and Google BigQuery are two popular solutions for software development projects. Both have their own unique benefits and drawbacks that need to be considered when deciding which to use.

To compare the two, consider the following:

1. **Scalability**: Hadoop is built on a distributed file system, allowing it to scale horizontally and store large amounts of data. BigQuery, on the other hand, is a cloud-based solution that allows for fast querying of large datasets.

2. **Cost**: Hadoop requires a lot of hardware and maintenance, making it more expensive than BigQuery. BigQuery, on the other hand, is a pay-as-you-go service, meaning you only pay for what you use.

3. **Speed**: Hadoop is slower than BigQuery due to its distributed nature. BigQuery, on the other hand, is designed to be fast and efficient, allowing for quick query processing.

4. **Flexibility**: Hadoop is more flexible than BigQuery, as it supports a variety of programming languages and frameworks. BigQuery, however, is limited to SQL.

5. **Security**: Hadoop provides a secure environment for data storage and processing, while BigQuery is a cloud-based solution with its own security measures.

Example code to compare the two:

```
# Hadoop
import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration

# BigQuery
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Create a Configuration object for Hadoop
conf = Configuration()

# Create a BigQuery client
client = bigquery.Client()

# Execute a query
query_job = client.query("SELECT * FROM my_dataset.my_table")

# Get the results
results = query_job.result()
```
