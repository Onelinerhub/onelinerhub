// plain

1. Apache Spark: Apache Spark is an open-source data processing framework that is often used as an alternative to Google BigQuery. It can be used for both batch and streaming data processing, and supports a wide range of programming languages. For example, the following code snippet shows how to read a CSV file using Spark:

```
val df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("/path/to/file.csv")
```

2. Amazon Redshift: Amazon Redshift is a cloud-based data warehouse service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It can be used for storing and analyzing large amounts of data, and is often used as an alternative to Google BigQuery. For example, the following code snippet shows how to run a SQL query using Redshift:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

3. Microsoft Azure Synapse: Microsoft Azure Synapse is a cloud-based analytics service offered by Microsoft. It can be used for data warehousing, data lakes, and data science. It is often used as an alternative to Google BigQuery. For example, the following code snippet shows how to run a SQL query using Azure Synapse:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

4. Presto: Presto is an open-source distributed SQL query engine that is often used as an alternative to Google BigQuery. It can be used for both interactive and batch queries, and supports a wide range of data sources. For example, the following code snippet shows how to run a SQL query using Presto:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

5. Apache Hive: Apache Hive is an open-source data warehousing system that is often used as an alternative to Google BigQuery. It can be used for both batch and interactive queries, and supports a wide range of data sources. For example, the following code snippet shows how to run a SQL query using Hive:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

6. Apache Drill: Apache Drill is an open-source distributed SQL query engine that is often used as an alternative to Google BigQuery. It can be used for both interactive and batch queries, and supports a wide range of data sources. For example, the following code snippet shows how to run a SQL query using Drill:

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

7. MongoDB: MongoDB is an open-source document database that is often used as an alternative to Google BigQuery. It can be used for both batch and interactive queries, and supports a wide range of data sources. For example, the following code snippet shows how to run a query using MongoDB:
