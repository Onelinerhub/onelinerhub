# How can I use Google Big Query for specific use cases?
// plain

Google Big Query is a powerful tool for data analysis and storage. It can be used for a variety of use cases, including analytics, data warehousing, and machine learning.

For example, you can use Big Query to analyze large datasets using SQL queries. The following code block shows how to use Big Query to query a dataset containing information about the top 10 most populous cities in the world:

```
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_population.population_by_city_2019`
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 10
```

This query returns the following output:

```
+-------------+---------------+-------------+
| city_name   | country_name  | population  |
+-------------+---------------+-------------+
| Shanghai    | China         | 24150000    |
| Beijing     | China         | 21516000    |
| Karachi     | Pakistan      | 14910352    |
| Istanbul    | Turkey        | 14160467    |
| Dhaka       | Bangladesh    | 14399000    |
| Tokyo       | Japan         | 13994000    |
| Moscow      | Russia        | 13802000    |
| SÃ£o Paulo   | Brazil        | 12252023    |
| Guangzhou   | China         | 12071000    |
| Mexico City | Mexico        | 11989000    |
+-------------+---------------+-------------+
```

The code block consists of the following parts:

1. `SELECT *` - This clause specifies which columns should be included in the query result. In this case, all columns from the table are selected.

2. `FROM `bigquery-public-data.world_population.population_by_city_2019` - This clause specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved.

3. `ORDER BY population DESC` - This clause specifies that the query results should be sorted in descending order by population.

4. `LIMIT 10` - This clause limits the number of results returned to 10.
