# How much does Google Big Query cost?
// plain

Google Big Query is a serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective cloud data warehouse. It is a fully managed data analytics service that allows users to analyze and query data quickly and securely.

The cost of Google Big Query depends on the type of data stored and the amount of data processed. For example, if you store 1 TB of data and process 10 TB of data, the cost would be $5 per TB.

The following code block is an example of how to calculate the cost of Google Big Query:
```
# Calculate cost of Google Big Query
data_stored = 1 # TB
data_processed = 10 # TB

cost = data_stored + data_processed

print("The cost of Google Big Query is ${}".format(cost))
```
The output of the example code is:
```
The cost of Google Big Query is $11
```
