# How do I use Google Big Query GA4 to analyze my data?
// plain

Google BigQuery GA4 is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze data from Google Analytics 4 (GA4). To use it, you must first create a BigQuery dataset and link it to your GA4 property.

Once you have done that, you can begin to write queries to analyze your data. For example, the following query will return the total number of pageviews for each page in your website:

```
SELECT page.page_path, SUM(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews
FROM `<your-ga4-dataset-id>.<your-ga4-table-id>`
GROUP BY page.page_path
```

The output of this query will look something like this:

```
page_path	pageviews
/home	1000
/about	500
/contact	200
```

## Code explanation


- `SELECT page.page_path, SUM(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews`: This part of the query selects the page path and the total number of pageviews for each page.

- `FROM `<your-ga4-dataset-id>.<your-ga4-table-id>`: This part of the query specifies the dataset and table from which the data should be retrieved.

- `GROUP BY page.page_path`: This part of the query groups the results by page path.
