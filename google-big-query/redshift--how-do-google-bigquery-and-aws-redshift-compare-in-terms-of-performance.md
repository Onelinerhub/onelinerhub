How do Google BigQuery and AWS Redshift compare in terms of performance?
// plain

Google BigQuery and AWS Redshift are two popular cloud-based data warehouses that are used to store and analyze large datasets. Both offer high performance and scalability, but there are differences in their architectures and capabilities.

BigQuery is a serverless, fully managed data warehouse that supports both standard SQL and BigQuery-specific SQL dialects. It is designed to handle large datasets with low latency and high throughput. BigQuery also supports streaming data, allowing for near real-time analysis of data.

On the other hand, Redshift is a columnar, distributed data warehouse that is optimized for high performance analytics. It supports standard SQL and is designed to scale up to petabytes of data. Redshift also offers a range of features such as data compression, data encryption, workload management, and query optimization.

In terms of performance, BigQuery is generally faster than Redshift when it comes to running queries on small datasets. However, Redshift tends to be faster than BigQuery when dealing with larger datasets. This is due to the fact that Redshift is optimized for larger datasets and can take advantage of its distributed architecture to process queries more quickly.

For example, the following code compares the performance of a query on a large dataset in BigQuery and Redshift:

```
// BigQuery
SELECT *
FROM dataset
WHERE id = 123

// Redshift
SELECT *
FROM dataset
WHERE id = 123
```

In this example, Redshift will generally be faster than BigQuery due to its optimized architecture for larger datasets.

Overall, BigQuery and Redshift both offer high performance and scalability. However, BigQuery is better suited for smaller datasets, while Redshift is better for larger datasets.
