# How can I use Google BigQuery to apply machine learning?
// plain

Google BigQuery provides a powerful and easy-to-use platform for applying machine learning (ML). BigQuery ML provides a simple SQL interface for training and evaluating ML models. To use BigQuery ML, you must first create a dataset, which is a table of data that can be used to train and evaluate your ML model.

Once you have a dataset, you can use the following example code to train a linear regression model in BigQuery ML:

```
#standardSQL
CREATE MODEL `my_model`
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg',
   input_label_cols=['target_column']) AS
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `my_dataset.my_table`
```

This code will create a linear regression model with the column `target_column` as the target label. The model will be trained using the data from the `my_dataset.my_table` table.

You can then use the following example code to evaluate the model's performance:

```
#standardSQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `my_model`,
    (
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      `my_dataset.my_table`
    )
  )
```

This code will return a result set with performance metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy.
