# How can I use Google BigQuery references in my software development project?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse platform that can be used to analyze large datasets. It can be used in software development projects to query and process data in a scalable and secure manner.

For example, the following code snippet can be used to query a BigQuery dataset and print the results:

```
from google.cloud import bigquery

client = bigquery.Client()
query = """
    SELECT *
    FROM `project.dataset.table`
"""
query_job = client.query(query)

for row in query_job:
    print(row)
```

## Code explanation

* `from google.cloud import bigquery` - imports the BigQuery library
* `client = bigquery.Client()` - creates a BigQuery client object
* `query = """ SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table`"""` - creates a SQL query to select all fields from a specified table
* `query_job = client.query(query)` - sends the query to BigQuery
* `for row in query_job: print(row)` - iterates through the query results and prints each row
