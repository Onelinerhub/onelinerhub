// plain

Google BigQuery BI is a powerful tool for analyzing data. It allows you to query large datasets quickly and easily, and provides powerful insights into your data.

Using BigQuery, you can write SQL queries to analyze your data. For example, you can use the following query to get the total number of visitors to your website:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS visitors
FROM `my-project.my-dataset.my-table`
```

This query would return the total number of visitors to your website.

You can also use BigQuery to perform more complex analyses on your data. For example, you can use the following query to get the average time spent on your website by visitors from a particular country:

```
SELECT AVG(time_spent) AS avg_time
FROM `my-project.my-dataset.my-table`
WHERE country = 'United States'
```

This query would return the average time spent on your website by visitors from the United States.

In addition to writing SQL queries, you can also use BigQuery to visualize your data. BigQuery provides a range of tools to help you visualize your data and gain insights into it.

You can find more information about BigQuery and how to use it to analyze your data in the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs).
