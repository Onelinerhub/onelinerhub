4. Accept the terms of service.
5. Click the "Activate" button.
6. Once your account is activated, you can start using BigQuery.
7. To test out BigQuery, you can run a simple SQL query in the BigQuery Console. For example, the following query will return the top 10 most populous cities in the world:

ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 10
```
