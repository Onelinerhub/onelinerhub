Learning to use Google Big Query is relatively straightforward. To get started, you can begin by reading the official documentation. This will provide you with an overview of the service and its features. Additionally, there are several tutorials available online that can help you understand the basics.

The best way to learn is to practice. To do this, you can create a project in the Google Cloud Platform console and use the Big Query web UI to create a dataset and query tables. You can also use the command line interface or the Big Query API to interact with the service.

Here is an example of a simple query that returns the sum of a column:

```
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
```

The output of this query will be the sum of the values in the `column_name` column of the `table_name` table.

To learn more about Big Query, you can also read blogs and tutorials from experts in the field. There are also several books available that cover the fundamentals of the service.
