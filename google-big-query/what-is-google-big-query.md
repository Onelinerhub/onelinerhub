# What is Google Big Query?
// plain

**Google BigQuery** is a serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective cloud data warehouse. It enables users to query petabytes of data in seconds using an SQL-like syntax. BigQuery is a fully managed service that runs on the Google Cloud Platform and supports both standard SQL and legacy SQL queries.

For example, the following code query retrieves the total number of records in a dataset:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [dataset_name.table_name];
```

The output of this query is the total number of records in the specified dataset.

## Code explanation


1. `SELECT`: Used to select columns from a table.
2. `COUNT`: Used to count the number of records.
3. `*`: Used to select all columns in a table.
4. `FROM`: Used to specify the dataset and table from which the data is to be retrieved.
