Google Big Query is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse service that allows users to store and analyze large datasets. To use the Google Big Query documentation, you can access the official documentation page [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs).

The documentation page is divided into several sections such as Tutorials, Reference, Solutions, and more. The Tutorials section provides step-by-step instructions on how to use Big Query, while the Reference section provides a comprehensive list of all the available commands and functions in Big Query.

For example, if you want to learn how to use the `CREATE TABLE` command, you can find the syntax and usage examples in the Reference section. The following code block shows an example of the `CREATE TABLE` command in Big Query:

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.mytable (
  id INT64,
  name STRING
)
```

The Solutions section provides detailed solutions to common tasks and problems in Big Query, such as loading data, querying data, and managing access control.

Finally, the official Big Query blog provides the latest news and updates about Big Query. You can find the blog [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigquery).
