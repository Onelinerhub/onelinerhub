# How do I use Google Big Query to rank my data?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful tool for analyzing large datasets. To rank data using BigQuery, you can use the `RANK()` window function. This function assigns a rank to each row in the result set based on the values of the expression in the `ORDER BY` clause.

For example, the following query will rank the rows based on the `amount` column in descending order:

```sql
SELECT name, amount,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) as rank
FROM my_table
```

The code above will produce the following output:

```
name          amount      rank
John Doe      1000        1
Jane Doe      500         2
Bob Smith     250         3
```

The code consists of three parts:

1. `SELECT` - specifies the columns to be included in the result set.
2. `RANK()` - assigns a rank to each row in the result set based on the values of the expression in the `ORDER BY` clause.
3. `ORDER BY` - specifies the column to sort the data by.
