# How do I use Google BigQuery to understand the meaning of data?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a cloud-based data warehouse that allows users to store, query, and analyze large datasets. It is an excellent tool for understanding the meaning of data.

To use BigQuery to understand the meaning of data, you first need to load the data into BigQuery. This can be done using the BigQuery web UI, the command-line interface, or the BigQuery API.

Once the data is loaded, you can use SQL to query the data and analyze it. For example, the following query will return the average age of users in a dataset:
```
SELECT AVG(age)
FROM dataset
```

The output of this query might be something like:
```
AVG(age)
35.5
```

This query can be used to understand the meaning of the data in the dataset, in this case, that the average age of users is 35.5.

You can also use BigQuery to perform more complex analysis, such as aggregating data by different dimensions, joining multiple datasets together, and using machine learning models.
