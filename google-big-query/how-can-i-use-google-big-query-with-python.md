# How can I use Google Big Query with Python?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse that allows you to store and query large datasets. It can be used with Python to access and manipulate data stored in BigQuery.

To get started, you'll need to install the Google Cloud SDK and the BigQuery Python client library. Then, you'll need to authenticate with your Google Cloud project.

```
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Construct a BigQuery client object.
client = bigquery.Client()
```

Once authenticated, you can query BigQuery datasets using the BigQuery Python client library. For example, the following code prints out the number of distinct users in a given dataset:

```
# Query to count the number of distinct users.
query = """
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS num_users
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
        """

# Run the query.
query_job = client.query(query)

# Print the results.
for row in query_job:
    print(row.num_users)

# Output:
# 877460
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `from google.cloud import bigquery`: imports the BigQuery Python client library
2. `client = bigquery.Client()`: initializes a BigQuery client object
3. `query = ...`: defines the query to be executed
4. `query_job = client.query(query)`: executes the query
5. `for row in query_job`: iterates over the query results
6. `print(row.num_users)`: prints the number of distinct users
