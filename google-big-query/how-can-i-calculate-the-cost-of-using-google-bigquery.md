# How can I calculate the cost of using Google BigQuery?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a managed cloud data warehouse service that allows you to store and query large datasets. To calculate the cost of using Google BigQuery, you will need to consider two main factors: storage costs and query costs.

Storage costs are based on the amount of data stored in BigQuery. Storage costs are charged in GB-months, which is the amount of data stored in a given month. For example, if you store 1 GB of data for a month, you will be charged for 1 GB-month.

Query costs are based on the amount of data processed by queries. BigQuery charges for queries in two ways: on-demand and flat-rate. On-demand pricing is based on the amount of data processed by each query. Flat-rate pricing is based on the number of queries executed in a given month.

The following example code block demonstrates how to calculate the cost of using BigQuery, using the BigQuery pricing calculator:

```
# Calculate BigQuery cost
storage_gb = 10
query_count = 100

# Storage cost
storage_gb_months = storage_gb * 1
storage_cost = storage_gb_months * 0.02

# Query cost
query_cost = query_count * 5

# Total cost
total_cost = storage_cost + query_cost

print("Total cost:", total_cost)
```

## Output example

```
Total cost: 105.0
```

The code above calculates the cost of using BigQuery by calculating the storage cost and query cost separately. The storage cost is calculated by multiplying the amount of data stored (in GB) by 1 (for one month) and multiplying the result by the cost per GB-month (0.02). The query cost is calculated by multiplying the number of queries executed by the cost per query (5). The total cost is then calculated by adding the storage cost and query cost.
