Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse that provides users with the ability to store, query, and analyze large datasets. To get started with BigQuery training, here are some steps to follow:

1. Sign up for a Google Cloud Platform account if you don't already have one.
2. Create a project and enable the BigQuery API.
3. Read the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/).
4. Follow the [Quickstart guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts) to get familiar with the BigQuery console.
5. Try running a query on a public dataset. For example, the following query will list the top 10 most populous cities in the world:
```
SELECT
  name,
  population
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_world_cities.world_cities`
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 10
```

6. Explore the [BigQuery tutorials](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/tutorials) and practice running queries on public datasets.
7. Take an online course or attend a workshop to learn more advanced techniques.
