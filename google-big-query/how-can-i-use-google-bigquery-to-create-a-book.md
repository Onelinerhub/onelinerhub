// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse solution that can be used to create a book. It allows users to store and query large datasets, making it ideal for creating a book.

To create a book using Google BigQuery, the following steps should be taken:

1. Create a dataset in BigQuery containing the data needed to create the book, such as text, images, and other content.

2. Use SQL queries to manipulate the data and create the book.

3. Use BigQuery's built-in visualization tools to create charts and graphs to supplement the book.

4. Export the data to a format that can be used to create the book, such as PDF, HTML, or EPUB.

## Example code

```
SELECT * FROM my_dataset.my_book ORDER BY title
```

## Output example

```
title                                          author
The Cat in the Hat                            Dr. Seuss
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone          J.K. Rowling
The Hobbit                                    J.R.R. Tolkien
```
