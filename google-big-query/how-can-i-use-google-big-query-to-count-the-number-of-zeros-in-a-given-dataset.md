# How can I use Google Big Query to count the number of zeros in a given dataset?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse that allows you to quickly and easily query large datasets. It provides an easy way to count the number of zeros in a given dataset.

For example, the following code block can be used to count the number of zeros in a dataset called 'my_dataset':

```
#standardSQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_zeros
FROM `my_dataset`
WHERE value = 0
```

The output of this query would be the number of zeros in the dataset.

The code block consists of the following parts:

- `#standardSQL`: This indicates that the query is written in the Standard SQL dialect.
- `SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_zeros`: This is the query that counts the number of zeros in the dataset.
- `FROM `my_dataset``: This is the dataset to query.
- `WHERE value = 0`: This is the condition that will be used to filter the dataset to only include rows with a value of 0.
