# How can I use Google Big Query with Udemy?
// plain

Google BigQuery is a powerful cloud-based data warehouse that allows users to store, query, and analyze data using SQL. With Udemy, you can use BigQuery to analyze the data from your Udemy courses.

For example, you can use BigQuery to query the data associated with your Udemy courses and gain insights into user behavior. This can help you understand which topics are resonating with your students, how long they are spending on each lesson, and how they are progressing through your course.

Here is an example of a BigQuery query that can be used to analyze the data from your Udemy courses:

```
SELECT
  course_id,
  topic_name,
  COUNT(*) AS num_views,
  AVG(time_watched_in_secs) AS avg_time_watched
FROM `udemy.user_data`
WHERE course_id = 'your_course_id'
GROUP BY course_id, topic_name
ORDER BY num_views DESC
```

This query will return the course_id, topic_name, number of views, and average time watched for each topic in your course.

Here is a list of the parts of the query and what they do:

- `SELECT`: This clause specifies which columns should be returned in the query results.
- `FROM`: This clause specifies which table the data should be queried from.
- `WHERE`: This clause specifies which rows should be returned in the query results.
- `GROUP BY`: This clause specifies how the rows should be grouped.
- `ORDER BY`: This clause specifies how the rows should be sorted.
