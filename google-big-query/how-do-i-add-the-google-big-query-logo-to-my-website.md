Adding the Google BigQuery logo to your website is a simple process.

1. First, you need to get the logo from the official Google BigQuery website. You can find the logo [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-logo).

2. Once you have the logo, you can add it to your website using HTML code. For example, you can use the following code block to add the logo to your website:
```
<img src="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-logo" alt="Google BigQuery Logo" />
```
This code will add an image to your website that looks like the Google BigQuery logo.

3. You can also customize the logo by adding additional HTML attributes to the code. For example, you can add the following code to make the logo larger:
```
<img src="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-logo" alt="Google BigQuery Logo" width="200" height="200" />
```
This code will add an image to your website that looks like the Google BigQuery logo, but it will be twice as large as the original logo.

4. You can also use CSS to further customize the logo. For example, you can use the following code to add a border to the logo:
```
<img src="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-logo" alt="Google BigQuery Logo" style="border: 2px solid #000000;" />
```
This code will add an image to your website that looks like the Google BigQuery logo, but it will have a black border around it.

By following these steps, you can easily add the Google BigQuery logo to your website.
