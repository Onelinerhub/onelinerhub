# How do you identify a backbone vertebrae?
// plain

A backbone vertebrae can be identified by looking at the shape and size of the vertebrae.

The vertebrae can be divided into five main regions: the body, the vertebral arch, the vertebral foramen, the transverse process, and the spinous process. The body is the main portion of the vertebrae and is the largest. The vertebral arch is the curved portion of the vertebrae that encircles the vertebral foramen. The vertebral foramen is the opening in the vertebrae through which the spinal cord passes. The transverse process is the portion of the vertebrae that extends laterally from the body of the vertebrae. The spinous process is the portion of the vertebrae that extends posteriorly from the body of the vertebrae.

To identify a backbone vertebrae, one can use a ruler to measure the size and shape of the vertebrae. The body should measure approximately 2-3 cm in length. The vertebral arch should be curved and measure approximately 1 cm in length. The vertebral foramen should measure approximately 0.5 cm in length. The transverse process should measure approximately 0.5 cm in length and the spinous process should measure approximately 0.5 cm in length.

A backbone vertebrae can also be identified using imaging tests such as X-rays or MRI scans. These imaging tests can provide detailed images of the vertebrae which can help to identify the shape and size of the vertebrae.

Below is an example of code that can be used to measure the size of a vertebrae:

```
# measure the size of the vertebrae
length_body = 2-3 cm
length_arch = 1 cm
length_foramen = 0.5 cm
length_transverse = 0.5 cm
length_spinous = 0.5 cm

# output the measurements
print("The body measures " + str(length_body) + " cm")
print("The arch measures " + str(length_arch) + " cm")
print("The foramen measures " + str(length_foramen) + " cm")
print("The transverse process measures " + str(length_transverse) + " cm")
print("The spinous process measures " + str(length_spinous) + " cm")

```
## Output example


The body measures 2-3 cm
The arch measures 1 cm
The foramen measures 0.5 cm
The transverse process measures 0.5 cm
The spinous process measures 0.5 cm
