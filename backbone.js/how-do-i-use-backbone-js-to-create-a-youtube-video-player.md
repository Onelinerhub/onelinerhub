# How do I use Backbone.js to create a YouTube video player?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that allows developers to create single-page applications (SPAs). To create a YouTube video player with Backbone.js, the following steps should be taken:

1. Create a Backbone.js application. This can be done by using the [Backbone Boilerplate](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/backbone-boilerplate) to create an application structure.

2. Create a view for the YouTube video player. This view should have a render() method that will be used to render the video player.

3. Create a model for the YouTube video. This model should have attributes such as the video's title, description, and URL.

4. Create a collection of YouTube videos. This collection should have a fetch() method that will be used to retrieve the videos from YouTube.

5. Create a router for the application. This router will be used to handle the different routes of the application.

6. In the router, create a route for the YouTube video player. This route should render the view and pass the model and collection to it.

```
// Router

var Router = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    'videos/:id': 'showVideo'
  },

  showVideo: function(id) {
    var video = new Video({ id: id });
    var videos = new Videos();
    var view = new VideoPlayerView({
      model: video,
      collection: videos
    });
    view.render();
  }
});
```

7. Finally, instantiate the router and start the application.

```
var router = new Router();
Backbone.history.start();
```
