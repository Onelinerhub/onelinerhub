# How can I use Backbone.js to wait for a fetch request to complete?
// plain

You can use the `fetch()` method in Backbone.js to wait for a fetch request to complete. `fetch()` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise. The promise will resolve when the fetch request is complete.

For example, you can use `fetch()` to make an AJAX request to a server and wait for the response:

```js
const response = await fetch('/url/to/endpoint');
```

The `response` object will contain the data returned from the server.

You can also use `fetch()` to make a POST request and send data to the server:

```js
const data = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 25
};

await fetch('/url/to/endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
});
```

This will send the data to the server and wait for the response.

You can also use the `done()` method to wait for a fetch request to complete:

```js
fetch('/url/to/endpoint')
  .done(() => {
    // Do something when the request is complete
  });
```

This will execute a callback function when the fetch request is complete.

For more information, see the [Backbone.js documentation](http://backbonejs.org/#fetch) and the [MDN documentation for fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
