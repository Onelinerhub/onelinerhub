# How can I trigger a hover event in Backbone.js?
// plain

To trigger a hover event in Backbone.js, you can use the `listenTo` method. This will allow you to listen to a specific event on an element and execute a callback when the event is triggered. For example:

```javascript
// Create a view
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: '#my-element',

  initialize: function() {
    // Listen to the hover event
    this.listenTo(this.$el, 'mouseover', this.onHover);
  },

  onHover: function() {
    console.log('Hover event triggered!');
  }
});

// Create a new instance of the view
var myView = new MyView();
```

## Output example
 `Hover event triggered!`

The code above does the following:

1. Create a view using `Backbone.View.extend()` which will be used to listen to the hover event.
2. Set the `el` property of the view to `#my-element`, which is the element we want to listen to the hover event on.
3. In the `initialize` function, we use the `listenTo` method to listen to the `mouseover` event on the element and execute the `onHover` function when the event is triggered.
4. The `onHover` function simply logs a message to the console.
