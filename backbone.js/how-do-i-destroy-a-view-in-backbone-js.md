# How do I destroy a view in Backbone.js?
// plain

To destroy a view in Backbone.js, you can use the `remove` method. This method will remove the view from the DOM and unbind all events associated with it.

## Example code

```
var view = new Backbone.View();
view.remove();
```

The code above will remove the view from the DOM and unbind all events associated with it.

The `remove` method has the following parts:

- `view`: This is the view instance that you want to remove.
- `remove()`: This is the method that will remove the view from the DOM and unbind all events associated with it.
