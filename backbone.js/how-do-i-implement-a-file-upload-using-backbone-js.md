# How do I implement a file upload using Backbone.js?
// plain

To implement a file upload using Backbone.js, you can use the [Backbone.Forms](https://github.com/powmedia/backbone-forms) library. This library provides a Backbone-based form framework which allows you to easily create forms with file uploads.

The following example code shows how to use Backbone.Forms to create a form with a file upload field:

```javascript
var form = new Backbone.Form({
  model: myModel
});

form.fields.add({
  name: 'file',
  type: 'file'
});

form.render();
```

The `type: 'file'` option is what tells Backbone.Forms to render a file upload field. Once the form is rendered, you can then use the `onSubmit()` method to handle the file upload:

```javascript
form.onSubmit = function(ev) {
  // Handle file upload here
};
```

You can also add additional fields to the form, such as text fields, to capture additional data associated with the file upload.

For more information, see the [Backbone.Forms documentation](https://github.com/powmedia/backbone-forms/).
