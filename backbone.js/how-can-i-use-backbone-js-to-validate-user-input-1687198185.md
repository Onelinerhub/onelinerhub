# How can I use Backbone.js to validate user input?
// plain

Backbone.js provides a set of validation methods to help you validate user input. It includes basic validation methods such as `validate` and `validateAll` which can be used to validate the model data.

For example, you can use the `validate` method in your model to check if the user input is valid:

```
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
  validate: function(attrs) {
    if (attrs.name.length < 5) {
      return "Name must be at least 5 characters long";
    }
  }
});
```

In the above example, the `validate` method checks if the `name` attribute of the model is at least 5 characters long. If it is not, the method returns a string with an error message.

You can also use the `validateAll` method to validate all the attributes in the model at once. For example:

```
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
  validateAll: function(attrs) {
    if (attrs.name.length < 5 && attrs.age < 18) {
      return "Name must be at least 5 characters long and age must be 18 or older";
    }
  }
});
```

In the above example, the `validateAll` method checks if the `name` attribute of the model is at least 5 characters long and if the `age` is 18 or older. If both conditions are not met, the method returns a string with an error message.

You can also use the `on` method to add custom validation logic to your models. For example:

```
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
  on: {
    'invalid': function(model, error) {
      alert(error);
    }
  }
});
```

In the above example, the `on` method adds a custom validation logic which will be triggered when the model is invalid. The `on` method takes two arguments, the first one is the model and the second one is the error message. The `alert` method will be triggered when the model is invalid and it will display the error message.

You can also use the `isValid` method to check if the model is valid or not. For example:

```
if (user.isValid()) {
  // do something
}
```

In the above example, the `isValid` method checks if the model is valid or not. If it is valid, the code inside the `if` statement will be executed.
