// plain

To view the history of Backbone.js, you can use the GitHub repository. Here is an example of how to do this:

```
git clone https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone.git
cd backbone
git log
```

The output of this command will be a list of commits, each with its own SHA, author, date, and message. This will show the history of changes to the Backbone.js codebase.

You can also view the history of Backbone.js on the GitHub repository page. Just go to the page and click on the "Commits" tab. This will show you the same information as the `git log` command.

Finally, you can also view the history of Backbone.js on the [Changelog](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) page. This page contains a detailed list of changes for each version of Backbone.js.
