# How do Backbone.js and Express differ in their usage for software development?
// plain

Backbone.js and Express are both popular frameworks for software development, but they have different uses.

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that helps developers create client-side applications. It provides a structure for organizing code, and it helps to create an application that is easy to maintain and extend. Backbone.js is often used for single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile applications.

For example, the following code snippet illustrates how Backbone.js can be used to create a simple model:
```
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        name: '',
        age: 0
    }
});

var user = new User({
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 25
});

console.log(user.get('name')); // Output: John Doe
```

Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It is used to create server-side applications, such as web APIs and web services. Express provides a set of features that make it easier to develop and maintain web applications, such as routing, middleware, and template engines.

For example, the following code snippet illustrates how Express can be used to create a simple web API:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    res.json([
        {
            name: 'John Doe',
            age: 25
        },
        {
            name: 'Jane Doe',
            age: 30
        }
    ]);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In summary, Backbone.js is used to create client-side applications, while Express is used to create server-side applications.
