# How can I use a Backbone.js playground to practice software development?
// plain

Backbone.js playgrounds are a great way to practice software development. They provide an environment to quickly and easily develop, test, and debug code in a web browser.

Here is an example of a simple Backbone.js application written in JavaScript:

```javascript
var AppView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: '#app',
  initialize: function() {
    this.render();
  },
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html("Hello World!");
  }
});

var appView = new AppView();
```

This code will render the text "Hello World!" in the HTML element with the ID of "app".

## Code explanation


- `var AppView = Backbone.View.extend({` - This creates a new Backbone view called AppView.
- `el: '#app',` - This sets the HTML element with the ID of "app" as the element for the view.
- `initialize: function() {` - This is a function which is called when the view is initialized.
- `this.render();` - This calls the render function of the view.
- `render: function() {` - This is the render function of the view.
- `this.$el.html("Hello World!");` - This sets the HTML content of the view element to "Hello World!".

Using a Backbone.js playground, you can quickly and easily test and debug your code. You can find a number of Backbone.js playgrounds online, such as [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), and [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/).
