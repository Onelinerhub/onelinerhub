# How do I set a model attribute in Backbone.js?
// plain

To set a model attribute in Backbone.js, you can use the `set()` method. This method takes an object with the attribute name and value as arguments. For example, if you wanted to set the `name` attribute of a model to `John`, you could do the following:

```javascript
var model = new Backbone.Model();
model.set({name: 'John'});
```

This will set the `name` attribute of the `model` to `John`.

The `set()` method also takes an optional `options` object as a second argument. This object can contain the following options:

- `silent`: A boolean value that determines whether a `change` event is triggered when the attribute is set.
- `validate`: A boolean value that determines whether the model's validation function is called when the attribute is set.
- `parse`: A boolean value that determines whether the model's data is parsed when the attribute is set.

For example, if you wanted to set the `name` attribute of a model to `John` without triggering a `change` event, you could do the following:

```javascript
var model = new Backbone.Model();
model.set({name: 'John'}, {silent: true});
```

This will set the `name` attribute of the `model` to `John` without triggering a `change` event.
