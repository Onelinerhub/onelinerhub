# How can I use Backbone.js with W3Schools?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library designed to help developers create single-page applications. It can be used with W3Schools to create interactive web applications.

## Example code

```
// Create a new Backbone Model
var MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
  // Define the Model's properties
  defaults: {
    title: '',
    description: ''
  },
  // Define custom methods
  sayHello: function(){
    console.log('hello');
  }
});

// Create a new instance of the Model
var myModel = new MyModel();

// Output the Model's data
console.log(myModel.toJSON());
```

## Output example

```
{title: '', description: ''}
```

The code above creates a new Backbone Model with two properties, `title` and `description`, and a custom method called `sayHello`. It then creates a new instance of the Model and logs the Model's data.
