# How do I use the Backbone idiom in software development?
// plain

Backbone.js is an open source library for developing web applications in JavaScript. It is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and provides a set of tools that help developers structure their code and maintain a separation of concerns.

In software development, the Backbone idiom is a way of organizing code that follows the MVC pattern. The idiom encourages developers to create models that represent the data in their application, views that render the data, and controllers that handle user input.

## Example code


```
// Define a model
var Person = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30
  }
});

// Instantiate the model
var person = new Person();

// Define a view
var PersonView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.model.get('name') + ' is ' + this.model.get('age') + ' years old.');
    return this;
  }
});

// Instantiate the view
var personView = new PersonView({ model: person });

// Render the view
personView.render();

// Output:
// John Doe is 30 years old.
```

The code above defines a model (`Person`) that contains two attributes (`name` and `age`), and a view (`PersonView`) that renders the model's attributes. The view is then instantiated and rendered, which outputs the following:

```
John Doe is 30 years old.
```

By following the Backbone idiom, developers can create applications that are maintainable and extensible.

## Code explanation


1. `Person`: This is a Backbone model that contains two attributes (`name` and `age`).
2. `PersonView`: This is a Backbone view that renders the model's attributes.
3. `person`: This is an instance of the `Person` model.
4. `personView`: This is an instance of the `PersonView` view.
5. `render()`: This is a method of the `PersonView` view that renders the model's attributes.
