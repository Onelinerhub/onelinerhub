# How do I use an online editor to write code with Backbone.js?
// plain

Using an online editor to write code with Backbone.js is relatively straightforward. First, you'll need to find a suitable online editor such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). Then, you'll need to add the necessary libraries to the editor. For example, if you're using JSFiddle, you can add the necessary libraries by clicking on the "Add Resources" button and then adding the libraries from the "External Resources" section.

Once the libraries have been added, you can then start writing code with Backbone.js. For example, the following code creates a simple `Backbone.View` that renders a message when it is initialized:

```javascript
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.render();
  },
  render: function() {
    this.$el.text("Hello, world!");
  }
});

var view = new MyView();
```

This code will output the following:

```
Hello, world!
```

In this example, the `MyView` class is defined using the `Backbone.View` class. The `initialize` method is called when the view is initialized, and the `render` method is used to render the view. The `this.$el` property is used to access the view's element and the `text` method is used to set its contents.

Finally, the `MyView` instance is created and the `render` method is called to render the view.
