# This keyphrase makes no sense and is too abstract to make a question.
// plain

The keyphrase "This keyphrase makes no sense and is too abstract to make a question" is not specific enough to provide an answer. In order to answer a question, it must be more specific and include information that can be answered.

For example, if the keyphrase was "What is the output of the following code block?", it would be much easier to 

```
#define MAX_LENGTH 10

int main()
{
    int array[MAX_LENGTH];
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < MAX_LENGTH; i++)
    {
        array[i] = i;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The output of the code block above is nothing, as the `main()` function returns an int and nothing is printed to the console.

The code block above has the following parts:

- `#define MAX_LENGTH 10`: This line defines the constant `MAX_LENGTH` as 10.
- `int array[MAX_LENGTH];`: This line creates an array of size `MAX_LENGTH` called `array`.
- `int i;`: This line creates an integer variable called `i`.
- `for (i = 0; i < MAX_LENGTH; i++)`: This line is a for loop that runs `MAX_LENGTH` times, assigning `i` to 0 on the first iteration and incrementing it by 1 each iteration.
- `array[i] = i;`: This line assigns the value of `i` to the `i`th element of the array `array`.
- `return 0;`: This line returns 0 from the `main()` function.
