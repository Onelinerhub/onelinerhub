# How can I decide between using Backbone.js and JavaScript for my software development project?
// plain

When deciding between using Backbone.js and JavaScript for a software development project, there are several factors to consider.

1. **Functionality** - Backbone.js provides a structure for creating single-page web applications, while JavaScript is a scripting language used to create dynamic webpages. Depending on the type of project, one may be more suitable than the other.

2. **Experience** - If the development team is experienced in working with JavaScript, then it may be the better choice. However, if the team is new to web development, then Backbone.js may be a better option since it provides a structure to help developers create web applications.

3. **Time** - Backbone.js provides a framework that can help speed up development, but it may take extra time to learn the framework. On the other hand, JavaScript can be more time consuming since it requires more coding.

4. **Code Example** - Here is a simple code example that shows how Backbone.js and JavaScript can be used together:

```
//Backbone.js Model
var Person = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30
  }
});

//JavaScript
var person = new Person();
console.log(person.get('name')); // Outputs "John Doe"
```

In conclusion, the best way to decide between Backbone.js and JavaScript for a software development project is to consider the project requirements, the development team's experience, and the amount of time available.
