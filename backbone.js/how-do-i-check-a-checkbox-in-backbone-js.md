# How do I check a checkbox in Backbone.js?
// plain

To check a checkbox in Backbone.js, you need to set the `checked` attribute of the checkbox to `true`. This can be done using the `set` method of the `Backbone.View` object.

For example, if you have a checkbox with an id of `myCheckbox`, you can check it using the following code:
```javascript
var view = new Backbone.View({el: '#myCheckbox'});
view.set('checked', true);
```

This code will set the `checked` attribute of the checkbox to `true`, thus checking it.

## Code explanation

- `Backbone.View`: A constructor function that creates a Backbone view object.
- `set`: A method of the `Backbone.View` object that sets the value of an attribute.
- `el`: An attribute of the `Backbone.View` object that holds a reference to the DOM element associated with the view.

For more information, see the [Backbone.js documentation](http://backbonejs.org/).
