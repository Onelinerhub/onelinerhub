# How do I create a view in Backbone.js?
// plain

To create a view in Backbone.js, you must define a view class that extends from the Backbone.View class. The view class should have a `render()` method, which is responsible for generating HTML for the view. Additionally, the view class should have an `events` object, which maps DOM events to view methods.

Example view class:
```
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
    // Define a render method
    render: function() {
        // Generate HTML for the view
        this.$el.html('<h1>My View</h1>');
        return this;
    },
    // Define an events object
    events: {
        'click h1': 'onHeadingClick'
    },
    // Define a view method
    onHeadingClick: function() {
        console.log('Heading clicked');
    }
});
```

## Output example
 `Heading clicked` when the `h1` element is clicked.

## Code explanation

- `MyView`: The view class name.
- `Backbone.View.extend`: The constructor used to create the view class.
- `render`: The view method responsible for generating HTML for the view.
- `events`: The object that maps DOM events to view methods.
- `onHeadingClick`: The view method that is called when the `h1` element is clicked.
