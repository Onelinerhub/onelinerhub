# How do I use Backbone.js UI components in my web application?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides a structure for developing rich, interactive web applications. It provides a number of UI components that can be used in your web application.

For example, you can use Backbone's Model and View components to create a simple UI element like a button:

```javascript
// Create a Backbone Model
var ButtonModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    label: 'Click Me'
  }
});

// Create a Backbone View
var ButtonView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html('<button>' + this.model.get('label') + '</button>');
    return this;
  }
});

// Create an instance of the model and view
var buttonModel = new ButtonModel();
var buttonView = new ButtonView({ model: buttonModel });

// Render the view
buttonView.render();
```

This will generate a simple button element with the label "Click Me".

Backbone also provides a number of other UI components, such as collections, routers, and events. These components can be used to create more complex user interfaces, such as forms, tables, and navigation menus.
