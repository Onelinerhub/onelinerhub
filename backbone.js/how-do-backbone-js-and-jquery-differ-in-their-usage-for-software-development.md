# How do Backbone.js and jQuery differ in their usage for software development?
// plain

Backbone.js and jQuery are both popular JavaScript libraries used for software development. However, they have different purposes and use cases.

Backbone.js is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework that provides structure to web applications by separating the data layer (Model) from the user interface (View). It is used to create single page applications (SPAs) with rich client-side functionality.

jQuery is a library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. It is used to create interactive web pages and applications.

For example, the following code block uses jQuery to add a class to a button element when clicked:
```
$('#button').on('click', function() {
    $(this).addClass('active');
});
```

In contrast, the following code block uses Backbone.js to create a model, view, and controller for a search form:
```
// Model
var SearchModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        query: ''
    }
});

// View
var SearchView = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: '#search-form',
    model: new SearchModel(),
    events: {
        'submit': 'onSubmit'
    },
    onSubmit: function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        this.model.set('query', this.$('input[name="query"]').val());
    }
});

// Controller
var SearchController = Backbone.Controller.extend({
    routes: {
        'search/:query': 'search'
    },
    search: function(query) {
        // Perform search based on query
    }
});
```

In summary, Backbone.js is used for creating SPAs with rich client-side functionality, while jQuery is used for creating interactive web pages and applications.
