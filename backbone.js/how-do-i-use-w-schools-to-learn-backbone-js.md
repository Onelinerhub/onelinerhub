1. W3Schools is a great resource to learn Backbone.js. It covers the fundamentals of the library, as well as more advanced topics.
2. To get started, go to the [Backbone.js Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_backbone.asp) page on W3Schools. This page contains a comprehensive overview of the library and its features.
3. To get a more in-depth understanding of Backbone.js, read through the [Backbone.js Documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_backbone_doc.asp). This page contains detailed descriptions of the library's components and functions.
4. To practice using Backbone.js, try out the [Backbone.js Examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_backbone_examples.asp) page. This page contains a number of example code blocks that demonstrate how to use the library.
5. For example, the following code block uses Backbone.js to create a simple model:
```
var Person = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30
  }
});

var person = new Person();

console.log(person.get('name')); // Output: John Doe
```
6. W3Schools also provides a [Backbone.js Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_backbone_ref.asp) page, which contains a comprehensive list of all the library's components and functions.
7. Finally, W3Schools also has a [Backbone.js Quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_backbone_quiz.asp) to test your knowledge of the library.
