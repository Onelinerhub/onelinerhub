# How do I use backbone.js in JavaScript?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides structure and organization to web applications by connecting models and views. It is a lightweight library that can be used to create single-page applications.

The following example shows how to use Backbone.js to create a model. The model is an object that contains the data and the methods to manipulate the data.

```javascript
// Create a new Backbone model
var Person = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30
  },

  initialize: function() {
    console.log('A new person has been created');
  }
});

// Instantiate a new model
var person = new Person();
```

## Output example

```
A new person has been created
```

The code above does the following:

1.  `var Person = Backbone.Model.extend({...})`: Creates a new Backbone model called `Person` with two default properties - `name` and `age`.
2.  `initialize: function() {...}`: This is a function that will be called when a new instance of the model is created.
3.  `var person = new Person()`: This line creates an instance of the `Person` model.
