# How can I decide between using Backbone.js and Node.js for my software development project?
// plain

Deciding between using Backbone.js and Node.js for a software development project depends on the specific needs of the project.

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that is used to create single-page applications, while Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that is used to create server-side applications.

If the project needs to create a single-page application, then Backbone.js should be used. For example, the following code creates a simple Backbone.js application that displays a message in the browser:

```
var MessageView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: '#container',
  render: function(){
    this.$el.html("Hello World!");
  }
});

var messageView = new MessageView();
messageView.render();
```

The output in the browser would be "Hello World!".

If the project needs to create a server-side application, then Node.js should be used. For example, the following code creates a simple Node.js application that prints a message to the console:

```
console.log("Hello World!");
```

The output in the console would be "Hello World!".

In summary, the choice between Backbone.js and Node.js for a software development project depends on the specific needs of the project. If a single-page application is needed, then Backbone.js should be used. If a server-side application is needed, then Node.js should be used.
