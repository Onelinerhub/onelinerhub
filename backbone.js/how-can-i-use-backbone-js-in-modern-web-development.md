# How can I use Backbone.js in modern web development?
// plain

Backbone.js is a popular JavaScript library used in modern web development for creating single-page applications. It provides an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework for organizing code and separating application logic from the user interface.

Backbone.js is used to create interactive user interfaces that respond to user actions and events. It provides a set of useful functions for manipulating data, such as fetching and saving data from a server.

## Example code

```
var Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    title: '',
    completed: false
  }
});

var myTodo = new Todo({ title: 'Learn Backbone.js' });

console.log(myTodo.get('title')); // Output: 'Learn Backbone.js'
```

The code above creates a Backbone.js Model called `Todo` which has two properties: `title` and `completed`. The `title` property is set to an empty string by default, and the `completed` property is set to `false` by default. The code then creates an instance of the `Todo` model and sets the `title` property to `'Learn Backbone.js'`. The `console.log` statement then prints the `title` property to the console.
