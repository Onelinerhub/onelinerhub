# How can I use Backbone.js Promises to simplify my software development process?
// plain

Backbone.js Promises are a powerful tool for simplifying software development processes. They allow developers to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, making it easier to read and debug.

For example, the following code uses a Backbone.js Promise to make an asynchronous AJAX call to a server and wait for the response before continuing:

```
var promise = $.ajax({
  url: '/some/url',
  dataType: 'json',
  data: {
    someData: 'someValue'
  }
});

promise.done(function(data) {
  console.log('Successful AJAX call!');
});
```

The output of this code would be:
```
Successful AJAX call!
```

The code consists of the following parts:
1. `var promise = $.ajax({...})`: This line creates a Backbone.js Promise and sets it to the `promise` variable.
2. `url: '/some/url'`: This line sets the URL of the AJAX call.
3. `dataType: 'json'`: This line sets the data type of the AJAX call.
4. `data: {someData: 'someValue'}`: This line sets the data that will be sent with the AJAX call.
5. `promise.done(function(data) {...})`: This line adds a callback to the promise that will be called when the AJAX call is successful.

Using Backbone.js Promises, developers can write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, making it easier to read and debug.
