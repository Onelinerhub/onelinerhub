# How do I use Backbone.js to bind events?
// plain

Backbone.js provides an API for binding and triggering custom events. It's easy to bind events to View objects, and the syntax is similar to jQuery. Here's an example:

```
// Create a new Backbone View
var view = new Backbone.View();

// Bind a custom event handler to the view
view.on("myEvent", function() {
  console.log("myEvent fired!");
});

// Trigger the custom event
view.trigger("myEvent");

// Output: "myEvent fired!"
```

The code above will create a new Backbone View object, bind a custom event handler to the view, and then trigger the custom event. The output will be "myEvent fired!".

The `on` method is used to bind an event handler to the view. The first argument is the event name, and the second argument is the event handler function. The `trigger` method is used to trigger the event, and any arguments passed after the event name will be passed to the event handler.
