To create a web application using Backbone.js and ASP.NET MVC, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Create a project in Visual Studio.
2. Add the Backbone.js library to the project.
3. Create a model class that will represent the data to be stored in the application.
4. Create a controller that will handle requests and responses.
5. Create an HTML page that will serve as the view for the application.
6. Create a JavaScript file that will contain the application logic.
7. Add the necessary routes to the application and test the application.

## Example code

```
public class MyModel
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

Parts of the code explained:
