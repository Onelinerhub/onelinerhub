# How can I update my Backbone.js application?
// plain

Updating a Backbone.js application can be done in a few steps:

1. Check for any updates to the Backbone library itself. This can be done by comparing the version of Backbone used in the application to the latest version available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone).

2. Update the application's codebase to take advantage of any new features or bug fixes introduced in the new version of Backbone.

3. Test the application to ensure it is still working as expected.

4. Deploy the updated version of the application.

Here is an example of updating a Backbone.js application to the latest version:

```javascript
// Get the latest version of Backbone
const Backbone = require('backbone');

// Update the existing codebase to take advantage of any new features
// or bug fixes introduced in the new version of Backbone
// ...

// Test the application to ensure it is still working as expected
// ...

// Deploy the updated version of the application
// ...
```
