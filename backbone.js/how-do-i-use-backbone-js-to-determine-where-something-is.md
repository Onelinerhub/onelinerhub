# How do I use Backbone.js to determine where something is?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides a structure for building web applications. It can be used to determine where something is by using its built-in methods.

For example, you can use the `get()` method to retrieve the coordinates of an element on the page.

```javascript
// Get the coordinates of an element
var coordinates = $('#element-id').get();
console.log(coordinates);
```

## Output example

```
{top: 100, left: 200}
```

The `get()` method takes in an element ID as an argument and returns an object containing the top and left coordinates of the element.

In addition to `get()`, Backbone.js also provides the `findWhere()` method which can be used to find an element by its attributes.

```javascript
// Find an element by its attributes
var element = $('#element-id').findWhere({
  class: 'my-class',
  data-attr: 'my-attr'
});
console.log(element);
```

## Output example

```
<div class="my-class" data-attr="my-attr"></div>
```

The `findWhere()` method takes in an object as an argument and returns the element that matches the given attributes.
