# How do I use Backbone.js to create a simple application for beginners?
// plain

Backbone.js is a great framework for creating simple applications. To get started, you'll need to include the Backbone.js library in your HTML. Then, you can create a simple application as follows:

1. Create a Model to represent the data of your application. The following example creates a Person model with two attributes: name and age.

```
var Person = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30
  }
});
```

2. Create a View to render the data of your application. The following example creates a PersonView that renders the Person model.

```
var PersonView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.model.get('name') + ' (' + this.model.get('age') + ' years old)');
    return this;
  }
});
```

3. Instantiate the Model and View. The following example creates a new Person instance and renders it with the PersonView.

```
var person = new Person();
var personView = new PersonView({ model: person });
personView.render();

// Output: John Doe (30 years old)
```

4. Add event listeners to your View. The following example adds an event listener to the PersonView that increases the age of the Person model when the view is clicked.

```
var PersonView = Backbone.View.extend({
  events: {
    'click': 'incrementAge'
  },
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.model.get('name') + ' (' + this.model.get('age') + ' years old)');
    return this;
  },
  incrementAge: function() {
    this.model.set('age', this.model.get('age') + 1);
  }
});
```

By following these steps, you can create a simple application with Backbone.js.
