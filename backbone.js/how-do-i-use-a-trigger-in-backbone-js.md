# How do I use a trigger in Backbone.js?
// plain

A trigger in Backbone.js is a way to bind a callback to a specific event. It is used to respond to changes in the models.

For example:

```
var model = new Backbone.Model();

model.on("change", function() {
  console.log("Model has changed!");
});

model.set("name", "John");

// Output: Model has changed!
```

In the example code above, a trigger is set on the model using `model.on("change", function() {...})`. Whenever the model's `name` attribute is changed, the callback function will be executed.

The parts of the code are:

- `var model = new Backbone.Model();`: This creates a new instance of the Backbone model.
- `model.on("change", function() {...})`: This sets the trigger on the model.
- `model.set("name", "John")`: This changes the model's `name` attribute and triggers the callback.

For more information about triggers in Backbone.js, see the [Backbone.js documentation](http://backbonejs.org/#Events).
