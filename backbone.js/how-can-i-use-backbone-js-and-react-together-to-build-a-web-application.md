# How can I use Backbone.js and React together to build a web application?
// plain

Backbone.js and React can be used together to build a web application in a number of ways.

One way is to use React as the view layer and Backbone as the model layer. This allows React to handle the UI elements while Backbone takes care of the data.

For example, if you have a model called `Book` with attributes `title` and `author`, you could create a React component that displays the book's title and author. The component would take in the `Book` model as a prop and render the attributes using JSX:

```javascript
const BookComponent = (props) => {
  const book = props.book;
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{book.title}</h2>
      <p>Written by {book.author}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This component could then be used in a Backbone view to render the book:

```javascript
const BookView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render() {
    const bookModel = this.model;
    return ReactDOM.render(
      <BookComponent book={bookModel} />,
      this.el
    );
  }
});

const bookView = new BookView({ model: bookModel });
bookView.render();
```

This is just one example of how Backbone and React can be used together. Other approaches include using React for both the view and model layers, or using Backbone as the view layer and React as the model layer.
