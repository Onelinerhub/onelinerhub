# How can I migrate from Backbone.js to React?
// plain

Migrating from Backbone.js to React can be done by breaking down the process into the following steps:

1. Decide on the architecture of the React application. This includes deciding on the component hierarchy, the data flow, and the state management.

2. Convert the Backbone models and collections to React components. This involves creating React components for each model and collection and adding the necessary properties and methods.

3. Convert the Backbone views to React components. This involves creating React components for each view and adding the necessary properties and methods.

4. Create the React application entry point. This involves creating the ReactDOM.render() method and passing in the root component.

5. Set up the routing. This involves setting up the React Router to handle the different routes in the application.

6. Add any additional components or features. This involves adding any additional components or features that the application requires.

7. Test and deploy the application. This involves running tests on the application and deploying it to a production environment.

## Example code

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Router, Route, IndexRoute, hashHistory } from 'react-router';

import App from './components/App';
import Home from './components/Home';
import About from './components/About';

ReactDOM.render((
  <Router history={hashHistory}>
    <Route path="/" component={App}>
      <IndexRoute component={Home}/>
      <Route path="about" component={About}/>
    </Route>
  </Router>
), document.getElementById('app'));
```

No output.
