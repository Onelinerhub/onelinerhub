# How should I decide between using Backbone.js and Knockout.js for my software development project?
// plain

When deciding between Backbone.js and Knockout.js for a software development project, the primary consideration should be the type of application you are building.

For example, if you are building a single page application (SPA) with a dynamic user interface, Knockout.js is a better choice. It is a library that helps create rich, responsive displays of data using a Model-View-Viewmodel (MVVM) pattern.

On the other hand, if you are building a more complex application with multiple views, models, and collections, Backbone.js may be a better choice. It is a library that helps organize your application's code into models, views, and collections, and provides a router for navigation.

Below is an example of code that uses Knockout.js to create a basic view model and bind it to an HTML page:

```
<div data-bind="text: name"></div>

<script>
    function AppViewModel() {
        this.name = ko.observable("John Doe");
    }

    ko.applyBindings(new AppViewModel());
</script>
```

The output of the above code will be the text "John Doe" displayed in the HTML page.

To summarize, when deciding between Backbone.js and Knockout.js for a software development project, consider the type of application you are building and the features you need.
