Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that can be used to create a web application. According to the tutorials from Javatpoint, the following steps can be used to create a web application using Backbone.js:

1. Create an HTML file and include the Backbone.js library.
```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.3.3/backbone-min.js"></script>
```

2. Create a Model to store data.
```
var Book = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        name: '',
        author: ''
    }
});
```

3. Create a Collection to store multiple models.
```
var BookList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    model: Book
});
```

4. Create a View to render the model or collection.
```
var BookView = Backbone.View.extend({
    tagName: 'li',
    render: function(){
        this.$el.html(this.model.get('name') + ' - ' + this.model.get('author'));
        return this;
    }
});
```

5. Instantiate the model, collection and view.
```
var book1 = new Book({name: 'Alice in Wonderland', author: 'Lewis Carroll'});

var bookList = new BookList([book1]);

var bookView = new BookView({model: book1});
```

6. Render the view.
```
$('#books').html(bookView.render().el);
```

7. Add new models to the collection.
```
bookList.add(new Book({name: 'The Hobbit', author: 'J.R.R. Tolkien'}));
```

By following these steps, you can use Backbone.js to create a web application according to Javatpoint tutorials.
