# How do I use Backbone.js to find an element in my code?
// plain

To find an element in your code using Backbone.js, you can use the `$el` property of the Backbone View. `$el` is a cached jQuery object that references the DOM element associated with the view.

For example:

```javascript
var view = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: '#my-element'
});

var myView = new view();

console.log(myView.$el);
// Output: [<div id="my-element"></div>]
```

In the above example, the `$el` property is used to cache a jQuery object of the DOM element with the `id` of `my-element`.

The parts of the code are:

1. `var view = Backbone.View.extend({ el: '#my-element' });` - This line creates a Backbone View with an element associated with it.

2. `var myView = new view();` - This line creates a new instance of the View.

3. `console.log(myView.$el);` - This line logs the cached jQuery object of the associated element.
