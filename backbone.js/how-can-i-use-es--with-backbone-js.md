# How can I use ES6 with Backbone.js?
// plain

Backbone.js is an open source JavaScript library that helps developers create single-page web applications. It offers a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure for organizing code and helps developers create highly interactive user interfaces. ES6 (ECMAScript 6) is the latest version of JavaScript, and it offers a number of features that make it easier to write and maintain code.

Using ES6 with Backbone.js is possible by using a transpiler such as Babel. Babel is a JavaScript compiler that takes ES6 code and converts it into ES5 code that can be run on any modern browser.

Here is an example of using ES6 with Backbone.js:

```
// ES6 code
import Backbone from 'backbone';

class MyModel extends Backbone.Model {
  constructor(options) {
    super(options);
  }
}

const myModel = new MyModel();
```

This example creates a new Backbone.Model class using ES6's class syntax. It then creates a new instance of the class called myModel.

## Code explanation


1. `import Backbone from 'backbone';` - This imports the Backbone library.
2. `class MyModel extends Backbone.Model { ... }` - This creates a new Backbone.Model class called MyModel.
3. `constructor(options) { ... }` - This is the constructor of the MyModel class.
4. `super(options);` - This calls the constructor of the parent class, Backbone.Model.
5. `const myModel = new MyModel();` - This creates a new instance of the MyModel class.
