# How can I use backbone.js to implement zoom functionality?
// plain

Backbone.js provides a useful library of functions for manipulating the DOM. To implement zoom functionality, we can use the `scale` function to increase or decrease the size of an element.

For example, to increase the size of an element with the id `#zoom-me` by a factor of 2, we could use the following code:

```
$('#zoom-me').scale(2);
```

The code above would increase the size of the element with the id `#zoom-me` by a factor of 2.

The code consists of the following parts:

- `$`: This is the jQuery selector, which is used to select the element with the id `#zoom-me`.
- `#zoom-me`: This is the id of the element that we are selecting.
- `.scale(2)`: This is the Backbone.js function that is used to scale the element by a factor of 2.
