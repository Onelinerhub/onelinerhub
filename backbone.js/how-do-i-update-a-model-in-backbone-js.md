# How do I update a model in Backbone.js?
// plain

Updating a model in Backbone.js is done by using the `set()` method. This method takes an object with the new model attributes as an argument. The following example code sets the `name` attribute of a model to `'John Doe'`:

```javascript
var myModel = new Backbone.Model({
  name: 'Jane Doe'
});

myModel.set({name: 'John Doe'});
```

The `set()` method triggers a `change` event, which can be used to update the view associated with the model. The following example code logs the new `name` attribute when the `change` event is triggered:

```javascript
myModel.on('change', function() {
  console.log(myModel.get('name'));
});

// Output: John Doe
```

The `set()` method can also take an `options` object as an additional argument. The `options` object can contain a `silent` property, which if set to `true` will prevent the `change` event from being triggered.

The `set()` method also takes a `validate` property, which can be used to validate the new attributes before they are set on the model. If the `validate` property is set to `true`, the `validate()` method of the model will be called before the attributes are set.

For more information, see the [Backbone.js documentation](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-set).
