# How do I use Backbone.js with JavaScript?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

To use Backbone.js with JavaScript, you first need to include the library in your HTML page. You can do this by adding the following code to the head section of your HTML page:
```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.3.3/backbone-min.js"></script>
```

Once the library is included, you can start using it to create models, views, collections, and routers. For example, you can create a simple model like this:
```
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: '',
    age: 0
  }
});

var user = new User();
console.log(user.get('name')); // Output: ''
```

In the above example, we created a model called `User` with two attributes: `name` and `age`. We then created an instance of the `User` model and used the `get` method to retrieve the value of the `name` attribute, which was an empty string.

You can also create views to render the models and collections, and routers to handle navigation between different pages.
