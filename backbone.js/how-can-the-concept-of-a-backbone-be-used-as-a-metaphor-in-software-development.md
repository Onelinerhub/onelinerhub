# How can the concept of a backbone be used as a metaphor in software development?
// plain

A backbone metaphor in software development is used to describe the core components of a software system. It is a way to visualize the underlying structure of a system and how the components interact.

For example, a web application could be described as having a backbone of a web server, a database, and an application server. The web server handles requests from web browsers, the database stores data, and the application server handles logic.

```
# Example code

# Web server
def handle_request(request):
    # handle the request

# Database
def store_data(data):
    # store the data

# Application server
def process_logic(logic):
    # process the logic
```

## Code explanation


1. `handle_request()` - a function to handle requests from web browsers.
2. `store_data()` - a function to store data in the database.
3. `process_logic()` - a function to process logic on the application server.

These three components are the backbone of the web application. They provide the foundation for the application to function.
