**Backbone** is an open-source JavaScript library that helps developers to structure their code in an organized way. It is based on the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern, which separates the data layer from the user interface layer. Backbone provides a rich set of features that allows developers to create complex web applications with a minimal amount of code.

The main components of Backbone are:

- **Models**: Models represent the data layer of an application and are responsible for managing the data. Models can be used to store and retrieve data from a database or from a remote API.

- **Views**: Views are responsible for rendering the user interface. They are responsible for displaying the data stored in the models.

- **Routers**: Routers are responsible for routing requests to the appropriate views.

- **Events**: Events are used to trigger actions when certain events occur.

An example of how to use Backbone is shown below:

```javascript
// Create a model
var Person = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 30
  }
});

// Create a view
var PersonView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: '#person',
  initialize: function() {
    this.render();
  },
  render: function() {
    var template = _.template($('#person-template').html());
    this.$el.html(template(this.model.toJSON()));
  }
});

// Create a router
var PersonRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    'person/:id': 'showPerson'
  },
  showPerson: function(id) {
    var person = new Person({id: id});
    var personView = new PersonView({model: person});
  }
});

// Start the router
var router = new PersonRouter();
Backbone.history.start();
```

This code will create a model, view, and router. The router will listen for requests with the route "person/:id", and when it receives such a request, it will create a new Person model and a PersonView to render the data.
