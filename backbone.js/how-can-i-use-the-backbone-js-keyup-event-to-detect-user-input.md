# How can I use the Backbone.js keyup event to detect user input?
// plain

Backbone.js provides a `keyup` event for detecting user input. To use it, you must first create a View object. Then, you can bind the `keyup` event to a callback function. The callback function will be triggered whenever the user presses a key.

For example, the following code will log a message to the console when the user presses a key:

```
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: '#my-view',

  events: {
    'keyup': 'onKeyup'
  },

  onKeyup: function() {
    console.log('User pressed a key!');
  }
});

var myView = new MyView();
```

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. The `MyView` View object is created by extending the `Backbone.View` object.
2. The `el` property is set to `#my-view`. This will be the element that the `keyup` event is bound to.
3. The `events` property is set to an object that maps the `keyup` event to the `onKeyup` callback function.
4. The `onKeyup` callback function is defined, which logs a message to the console when the user presses a key.
5. The `MyView` View object is instantiated.

Whenever the user presses a key while the element with the ID `my-view` is focused, the message `User pressed a key!` will be logged to the console.
