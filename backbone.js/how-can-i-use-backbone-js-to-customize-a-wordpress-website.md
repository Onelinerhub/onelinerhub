# How can I use Backbone.js to customize a WordPress website?
// plain

Backbone.js can be used to customize a WordPress website by adding a custom JavaScript layer. This layer can be used to add functionality to the WordPress website without having to modify the core code.

For example, the following code will add a custom `helloWorld` function to the WordPress website that will output a string when called:

```javascript
// Create a custom function
function helloWorld() {
	console.log('Hello World!');
}

// Add the function to the global scope
window.helloWorld = helloWorld;
```

When the above code is executed, the following output will be displayed in the console:

```
Hello World!
```

The code consists of two parts:

1. The `helloWorld` function, which is the custom functionality that will be added to the WordPress website.
2. The `window.helloWorld` statement, which adds the `helloWorld` function to the global scope, making it available to the WordPress website.
