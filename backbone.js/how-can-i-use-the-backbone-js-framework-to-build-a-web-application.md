# How can I use the Backbone.js framework to build a web application?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides an MVC framework for developing web applications. It helps to structure your application's code and provides the necessary tools for creating single-page applications.

To use Backbone.js to build a web application, you need to include the Backbone.js library in your HTML page, create a model, view, and collection, and then bind the model and view together.

For example, the following code creates a simple model:
```
var Person = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: '',
    age: 0
  }
});
```

The following code creates a view:
```
var PersonView = Backbone.View.extend({
  tagName: 'li',
  render: function(){
    this.$el.html(this.model.get('name'));
    return this;
  }
});
```

And the following code binds the model and view together:
```
var person = new Person({name: 'John', age: 25});
var personView = new PersonView({model: person});
$('#container').html(personView.render().el);
// Output: <li>John</li>
```

## Code explanation

- `Person`: a Backbone.js model that stores data about a person
- `PersonView`: a Backbone.js view that renders the person's name
- `person`: an instance of the `Person` model
- `personView`: an instance of the `PersonView` view
- `render()`: a function that renders the view
