# How do I add a change event handler to a Backbone.js object?
// plain

Adding a change event handler to a Backbone.js object is simple. First, create a Backbone.js object and assign it to a variable:

```
var myObject = new Backbone.Model({
    name: 'John',
    age: 30
});
```

Then, use the `on()` method to bind a change event handler to the object:

```
myObject.on('change', function() {
    console.log('The object has changed!');
});
```

This will cause the event handler to be invoked whenever the object's data changes. To test this, we can change the object's data and see the output:

```
myObject.set('name', 'Bob');
// Output: The object has changed!
```

The `on()` method takes two parameters: the event name (in this case, `change`) and the event handler function. The event handler function will be invoked with the object as its first parameter.

## Code explanation


1. `var myObject = new Backbone.Model({ name: 'John', age: 30 });` - Create a Backbone.js object and assign it to a variable.
2. `myObject.on('change', function() { console.log('The object has changed!'); });` - Bind a change event handler to the object.
3. `myObject.set('name', 'Bob');` - Change the object's data.
