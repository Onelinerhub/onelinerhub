# What are the benefits of using Backbone.js for software development?
// plain

1. Backbone.js is a lightweight, open-source JavaScript library that is used for developing single-page web applications. It provides developers with an organized structure for their projects, allowing them to easily create complex client-side applications.

2. Backbone.js enables developers to create a well-structured application with a clear separation of concerns. This makes it easier to maintain and scale the application, as well as to debug and refactor it.

3. Backbone.js provides a rich set of features including models, collections, views, routers and events. For example, models are used to store and retrieve data from the server, collections are used to manage a set of models, and views are used to render the data to the user.

4. Backbone.js also provides an event-driven architecture that allows developers to easily create custom events and listen for them. This makes it easier to create complex interactions between different components in the application.

5. Backbone.js also supports a wide range of plugins and extensions that can be used to extend the functionality of the library. This makes it easy for developers to quickly add additional features to their applications.

6. Backbone.js also supports a range of popular front-end frameworks such as React, Angular and Vue. This makes it easy to integrate Backbone.js with these frameworks.

7. Finally, Backbone.js is well-documented and has an active community of developers who are willing to help out with any issues.

Example code block

```
// Create a new Backbone model
var Model = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: 'John Doe'
  }
});

// Create a new instance of the model
var model = new Model();

// Get the name of the model
console.log(model.get('name'));
```

Output of example code

`John Doe`
