# How can I use Backbone as a spine for software development?
// plain

Backbone is a JavaScript library that provides a structure for developing software applications. It is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, which means it separates the application into three parts: the Model (the data), the View (the user interface), and the Controller (the logic). Backbone provides a set of tools to interact with these components, such as Views, Models, Collections, and Routers.

For example, the following code shows a basic Backbone application:

```
var App = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "": "index",
    "about": "about"
  },
  index: function() {
    console.log("This is the index page");
  },
  about: function() {
    console.log("This is the about page");
  }
});

var app = new App();
Backbone.history.start();
```

This code creates a Router, which is responsible for handling the application's routes (URLs). The code also defines two routes, one for the index page and one for the about page. Finally, it starts the Backbone History, which is responsible for tracking the application's state.

## Code explanation


* `var App = Backbone.Router.extend({` - creates a new Router object.
* `routes: {` - defines the routes for the application.
* `index: function() {` - defines the logic for the index route.
* `about: function() {` - defines the logic for the about route.
* `var app = new App();` - creates a new instance of the App Router.
* `Backbone.history.start();` - starts the Backbone History.

Backbone provides a powerful structure for software development, allowing developers to easily separate the application's logic, data, and user interface.
