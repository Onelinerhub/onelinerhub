# What is Backbone.js and how is it used?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides structure and organization to web applications by providing a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. It is used to create single page applications (SPAs) that can handle heavy client-side processing without the need for a page refresh.

Backbone.js is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which is a design pattern that separates the application into three parts: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (logic). The model is responsible for managing the data of the application, the view is responsible for displaying the data, and the controller is responsible for handling the user input and updating the model and view accordingly.

## Example code

```
// create a new Backbone model
var model = new Backbone.Model({
  name: 'John',
  age: 24
});

// set a new attribute
model.set('location', 'New York');

// get an attribute
var location = model.get('location');

// output
console.log(location); // 'New York'
```

The code above creates a new Backbone model with two attributes (name and age) and then sets a new attribute (location). Finally, it retrieves the value of the location attribute and logs it to the console.

## Code explanation


1. `var model = new Backbone.Model({...})`: This creates a new Backbone model object and sets the initial attributes (name and age).
2. `model.set('location', 'New York')`: This sets a new attribute (location) on the model object.
3. `var location = model.get('location')`: This retrieves the value of the location attribute from the model object.
4. `console.log(location)`: This logs the value of the location attribute to the console.
