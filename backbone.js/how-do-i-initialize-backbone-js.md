# How do I initialize Backbone.js?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that helps to structure client-side code. It can be initialized by including the library in an HTML file and creating a new Backbone.js object.

## Example

```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.4.0/backbone.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var myBackboneObject = new Backbone.Model();
</script>
```

This example code creates a new Backbone.js object called `myBackboneObject` that can be used to store and retrieve data.

The first line of code includes the Backbone.js library from a CDN. The second line creates a new Backbone.js object using the `new Backbone.Model()` syntax.

## Code explanation


1. `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.4.0/backbone.min.js"></script>` - This line includes the Backbone.js library from a CDN.
2. `var myBackboneObject = new Backbone.Model();` - This line creates a new Backbone.js object called `myBackboneObject` that can be used to store and retrieve data.
