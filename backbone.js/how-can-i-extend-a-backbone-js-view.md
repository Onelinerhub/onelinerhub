# How can I extend a Backbone.js view?
// plain

You can extend a Backbone.js view by creating a new view which inherits from the existing view.

```
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // ...
});

// Extend MyView
var MyExtendedView = MyView.extend({
  // ...
});
```

The `MyExtendedView` will inherit all of the properties and methods of `MyView`. You can then add additional properties and methods to `MyExtendedView` to customize it.

For example, you could add a custom `initialize` method to `MyExtendedView`:

```
var MyExtendedView = MyView.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    console.log('My extended view has been initialized');
  }
});
```

The output of this code would be:

```
My extended view has been initialized
```

You can also override existing properties and methods in `MyExtendedView`:

```
var MyExtendedView = MyView.extend({
  render: function() {
    console.log('My extended view has been rendered');
  }
});
```

The output of this code would be:

```
My extended view has been rendered
```
