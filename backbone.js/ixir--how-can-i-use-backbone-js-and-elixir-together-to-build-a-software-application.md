How can I use Backbone.js and Elixir together to build a software application?
// plain

Backbone.js and Elixir can be used together to build a software application. Backbone.js provides a framework for creating single-page applications and Elixir provides a language for writing robust, maintainable code. To use both together, you will need to create an application that uses both frameworks.

For example, you could create a web application using Backbone.js for the front-end and Elixir for the back-end. You could use the Backbone.js router to define your application's routes and the Elixir Phoenix framework to provide the API for the application.

The following example code shows how you can use Backbone.js and Elixir together to create a simple web application:

```javascript
// Backbone.js
var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
    routes: {
        "/": "home",
        "/about": "about"
    },
    home: function() {
        console.log("You are on the home page");
    },
    about: function() {
        console.log("You are on the about page");
    }
});

var router = new AppRouter();
Backbone.history.start();
```

```elixir
# Elixir
defmodule MyApp.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  # Routes
  get "/", HomeController, :index
  get "/about", AboutController, :index
end
```

The code above will create two routes, one for the home page and one for the about page. The Backbone.js router will handle the front-end routing, and the Elixir router will handle the back-end routing.

Parts of the code explained:
- Backbone.js router: This is the Backbone.js router which defines the application's routes and handles the front-end routing.
- Elixir router: This is the Elixir router which defines the application's routes and handles the back-end routing.
