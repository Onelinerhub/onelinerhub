# How can I use Backbone.js with Node.js?
// plain

Backbone.js can be used with Node.js to create a structured and organized web application. To do this, the first step is to install the Backbone.js package in your Node.js project. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install backbone
```

Once installed, you can use the Backbone.js library in your Node.js application. For example, you could create a Backbone.Model to represent your data:

```
var MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: '',
    age: 0
  }
});

var myModel = new MyModel({
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
});

console.log(myModel.get('name')); // Output: John
```

In this example, we created a Backbone.Model called MyModel with two attributes, `name` and `age`. We then created an instance of the model and set the values of `name` and `age` to `John` and `30` respectively. Finally, we logged the value of the `name` attribute.

To learn more about using Backbone.js with Node.js, you can read the [Backbone.js documentation](https://backbonejs.org/) and the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).
