# How can I quickly get started with Backbone.js?
// plain

1. First, read the [Backbone.js documentation](http://backbonejs.org/) to understand the core concepts and components of the library.

2. To get started with Backbone.js, you will need a web server and a browser. You can use a local web server like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/).

3. Create an HTML page and include the Backbone.js library. You can either download the library or include it from a CDN.

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone.js/1.3.3/backbone-min.js"></script>
```

4. Create a Backbone Model to store data. The model will have attributes and methods to manipulate the data.

```javascript
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        name: '',
        age: 0
    }
});

var user = new User({name: 'John', age: 25});
```

5. Create a Backbone View to represent the data in the model. The view will have methods to render the data in the browser.

```javascript
var UserView = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: '#user-info',
    render: function(){
        this.$el.html(this.model.get('name') + ' is ' + this.model.get('age') + ' years old.');
        return this;
    }
});

var userView = new UserView({model: user});
userView.render();
```

6. Create a Backbone Router to handle navigation in the application. The router will define routes and callbacks to handle different routes.

```javascript
var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
    routes: {
        '': 'index',
        'user': 'showUser'
    },
    index: function(){
        // show the index page
    },
    showUser: function(){
        // show the user page
    }
});

var router = new AppRouter();
Backbone.history.start();
```

7. Finally, you can use Backbone events to bind events to the model, view, and router. This will allow your application to respond to user actions.

```javascript
user.on('change', function(){
    // update the view
    userView.render();
});
```
