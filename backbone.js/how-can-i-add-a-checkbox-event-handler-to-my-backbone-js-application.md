# How can I add a checkbox event handler to my Backbone.js application?
// plain

To add a checkbox event handler to your Backbone.js application, you can use the `listenTo` method to bind the event to the view.

## Example code

```
this.listenTo(this.model, 'change:checked', this.handleCheck);
```

This code will bind the `change:checked` event to the view, which is triggered when the checkbox value changes. The `handleCheck` function is then called when the event is triggered.

The `handleCheck` function can be written to do whatever you want it to do. For example, it could update some data in the model:

```
handleCheck: function(model, value) {
    model.set('data', value);
}
```

This code will update the `data` property of the model when the checkbox value changes.
