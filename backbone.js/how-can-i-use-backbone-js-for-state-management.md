# How can I use Backbone.js for state management?
// plain

Backbone.js is an MVC web framework that can be used for state management. It provides a simple API for creating models, collections, and views, which can be used to store and manipulate the application's state.

For example, a simple model can be used to store the current state of a form:

```javascript
var FormState = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: '',
    email: ''
  }
});

var formState = new FormState();
```

The model can then be used to store the values of the form inputs:

```javascript
formState.set('name', 'John Doe');
formState.set('email', 'john@example.com');
```

The values can then be retrieved when needed:

```javascript
console.log(formState.get('name')); // 'John Doe'
console.log(formState.get('email')); // 'john@example.com'
```

Backbone.js also provides a way to bind models to views, so that when the model's state changes, the view will automatically update. This allows the application state to be managed in a single place, and the UI to be kept in sync with the data.
