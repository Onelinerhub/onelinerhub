# How can Backbone.js be used to create dynamic web applications?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that is used to create dynamic web applications. It provides an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework that helps in separating the application logic from the user interface. Backbone.js makes it easier to create single page applications by providing the structure and tools for managing the data and application logic.

For example, the following code creates a Backbone Model that defines the data structure and methods for manipulating the data:

```
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: '',
    age: 0
  },
  setName: function(name) {
    this.set({name: name});
  },
  setAge: function(age) {
    this.set({age: age});
  }
});
```

The code creates a User model with two attributes: name and age. It also provides two methods for setting the values of these attributes.

Backbone.js also provides a View object that is used to create and manage the user interface. The View object listens to changes in the Model and updates the user interface accordingly.

For example, the following code creates a View object that displays the User model in an HTML table:

```
var UserView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: '#user-table',
  template: _.template('<tr><td><%= name %></td><td><%= age %></td></tr>'),
  initialize: function() {
    this.model.on('change', this.render, this);
  },
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template(this.model.toJSON()));
    return this;
  }
});
```

The code creates a View object with a template that displays the User model in an HTML table. It also adds a listener to the model that triggers the render function when the model changes.

By combining Models and Views, Backbone.js makes it easy to create dynamic web applications.

Parts of the example code:

* `User` - a Backbone Model that defines the data structure and methods for manipulating the data.
* `setName` and `setAge` - methods for setting the values of the `name` and `age` attributes.
* `UserView` - a Backbone View object that displays the User model in an HTML table.
* `el` - the element that the View object will be attached to.
* `template` - a template that is used to display the User model.
* `initialize` - a function that adds a listener to the model that triggers the render function when the model changes.
* `render` - a function that renders the User model in an HTML table.
