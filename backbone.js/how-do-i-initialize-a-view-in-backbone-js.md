# How do I initialize a view in Backbone.js?
// plain

To initialize a view in Backbone.js, you must first create a view object and then define its properties. The view object must extend the Backbone.View class, which provides the basic functionality for a view.

For example:
```javascript
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({

  // Properties
  el: "#view",
  template: _.template("<h1>My View</h1>"),

  // Initialize
  initialize: function() {
    this.render();
  },

  // Render
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template());
  }

});

// Create a new view
var view = new MyView();
```

The code above will create a new view object called `MyView` which is an extension of the `Backbone.View` class. It sets the `el` property to `#view` and the `template` property to a template string. It also defines an `initialize` function which calls `render` when the view is initialized. The `render` function then sets the HTML of the view's `el` to the template string. Finally, a new instance of the view is created and assigned to the `view` variable.

**Parts of the code and explanation:**
- `var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({` - This creates a new view object called `MyView` which is an extension of the `Backbone.View` class.
- `el: "#view"` - This sets the `el` property to `#view`. This is the DOM element that the view will be attached to.
- `template: _.template("<h1>My View</h1>")` - This sets the `template` property to a template string. This is the HTML that will be rendered by the view.
- `initialize: function() {` - This defines an `initialize` function which is called when the view is initialized.
- `render: function() {` - This defines a `render` function which sets the HTML of the view's `el` to the template string.
- `var view = new MyView();` - This creates a new instance of the view and assigns it to the `view` variable.
