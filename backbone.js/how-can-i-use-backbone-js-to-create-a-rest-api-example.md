# How can I use Backbone.js to create a REST API example?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that can be used to create a REST API example. It provides a number of features that make it ideal for creating an API, including the ability to define models with custom attributes, collections of models, and views with custom events.

To create a REST API example with Backbone.js, you will need to start by creating a model to represent the data that will be stored in the API. For example:

```js
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        first_name: '',
        last_name: ''
    }
});
```

Next, you will need to create a collection to store the models and provide a way to access them. For example:

```js
var Users = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    model: User
});
```

Finally, you will need to create a view to handle the requests and responses. For example:

```js
var UsersView = Backbone.View.extend({
    initialize: function() {
        this.collection = new Users();
    },

    events: {
        'GET /users': 'getUsers'
    },

    getUsers: function() {
        this.collection.fetch();
    }
});
```

This is just a basic example of how to use Backbone.js to create a REST API example. For more information, see the [Backbone.js documentation](http://backbonejs.org/) and the [RESTful API tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-restful-apis-with-backbone-js/).
