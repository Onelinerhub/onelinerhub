# How can I use Backbone.js, Fresco Play, and hands-on techniques to develop software?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that allows developers to create structured applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

Fresco Play is a cloud-based platform for developing, testing, and deploying web and mobile applications. It provides a unified development environment that allows developers to create applications with both front-end and back-end code.

Hands-on techniques are used to create software by writing code, debugging, and testing.

To use Backbone.js, Fresco Play, and hands-on techniques to develop software, you will need to:

1. Create a model in Backbone.js to structure your application.

```
var Model = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        name: '',
        age: 0
    }
});
```

2. Connect the model to your existing API with a RESTful JSON interface.

3. Use Fresco Play to develop the front-end and back-end code for the application.

4. Use hands-on techniques to write the code, debug, and test the application.
