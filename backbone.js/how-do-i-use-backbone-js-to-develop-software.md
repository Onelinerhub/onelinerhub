# How do I use Backbone.js to develop software?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that helps developers structure their code and create single page applications. To use Backbone.js to develop software, you need to include the Backbone.js library in your HTML page and then use the Backbone objects and functions to create your application.

For example, the following code creates a Model object with a property called 'name', and then sets the value of the property to 'John':

```javascript
// Create a Model object
var person = new Backbone.Model();

// Set the property 'name'
person.set('name', 'John');
```

This code will set the property 'name' of the person Model object to 'John'.

To create views and bind them to the Model objects, you can use the Backbone.View object. For example, the following code creates a view that binds to the person Model object and displays the value of the 'name' property:

```javascript
// Create a View object
var personView = new Backbone.View({
  model: person
});

// Render the view
personView.render = function(){
  console.log(this.model.get('name'));
};

personView.render();
// Output: John
```

In this example, the view is rendered and the output is 'John', which is the value of the 'name' property of the person Model object.

To create collections and bind them to the Model objects, you can use the Backbone.Collection object. For example, the following code creates a collection of persons and binds it to the person Model object:

```javascript
// Create a Collection object
var persons = new Backbone.Collection([person]);

// Display the number of persons in the collection
console.log(persons.length);
// Output: 1
```

In this example, the collection contains one person and the output is '1'.

These are just a few examples of how to use Backbone.js to develop software. To learn more, you can refer to the official Backbone.js documentation or take a look at the tutorials available online.
