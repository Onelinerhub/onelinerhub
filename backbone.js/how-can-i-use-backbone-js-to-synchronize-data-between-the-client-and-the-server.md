# How can I use Backbone.js to synchronize data between the client and the server?
// plain

Backbone.js provides a way to synchronize data between the client and the server via its Model and Collection objects. Models represent individual data objects, and Collections represent a group of Models.

To keep the data in sync between the client and server, Backbone.js provides a number of methods that can be used to send data to and from the server. These include `fetch`, `save`, `destroy`, and `sync`.

For example, to fetch a collection of data from a server, you can use the following code:

```javascript
var myCollection = new Backbone.Collection();
myCollection.fetch({
    url: '/myData',
    success: function(collection, response, options) {
        console.log('Data fetched!');
    },
    error: function(collection, response, options) {
        console.log('Error fetching data!');
    }
});
```

This code will send a request to the server at `/myData` and, if successful, will log a message to the console.

Similarly, to save a model to the server, you can use the following code:

```javascript
var myModel = new Backbone.Model();
myModel.save({
    url: '/myData',
    success: function(model, response, options) {
        console.log('Data saved!');
    },
    error: function(model, response, options) {
        console.log('Error saving data!');
    }
});
```

This code will send a request to the server at `/myData` and, if successful, will log a message to the console.

In addition, Backbone.js also provides a `sync` method which can be used to send data to and from the server.
