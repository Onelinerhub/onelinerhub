# Is there a difference between the backbone and the spinal cord?
// plain

Yes, there is a difference between the backbone and the spinal cord.

The backbone is a series of vertebrae that run along the length of the body, from the base of the skull to the tailbone. It provides structural support and flexibility to the body. The spinal cord, on the other hand, is a bundle of nerves that runs through the backbone and connects the brain to the rest of the body.

The following code block shows an example of how to access the spinal cord from the backbone:

```
# Get the spinal cord from the backbone
spinal_cord = backbone.get_spinal_cord()
```

The code above consists of two parts:
1. `backbone.get_spinal_cord()` - This is a method that will return the spinal cord from the backbone.
2. `spinal_cord` - This is a variable that will be assigned the value of the spinal cord that is returned from the `get_spinal_cord()` method.
