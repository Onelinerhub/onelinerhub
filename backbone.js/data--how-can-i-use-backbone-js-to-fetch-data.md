How can I use Backbone.js to fetch data?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides a simple way to fetch data from an external source. It allows you to create a Model object which will be used to retrieve data from the source. To fetch data using Backbone.js, you need to create a Model object and then call the fetch() method on it.

## Example code

```
// Create a new Model object
var model = new Backbone.Model();

// Fetch data from the external source
model.fetch({
  url: 'http://example.com/data',
  success: function(model, response) {
    // Handle successful response
  },
  error: function(model, response) {
    // Handle failed response
  }
});
```

The code above will create a new Model object and then call the fetch() method on it. The fetch() method takes an object as its parameter, which contains the URL of the external source and a callback function that will be called when the data is successfully fetched or an error occurs.

The following list explains the parts of the code above:

- **var model = new Backbone.Model();** - This line creates a new Model object.
- **url: 'http://example.com/data'** - This is the URL of the external source from which the data will be fetched.
- **success: function(model, response) { ... }** - This is the callback function that will be called when the data is successfully fetched. It takes two parameters - the Model object and the response from the server.
- **error: function(model, response) { ... }** - This is the callback function that will be called when an error occurs. It also takes two parameters - the Model object and the response from the server.
