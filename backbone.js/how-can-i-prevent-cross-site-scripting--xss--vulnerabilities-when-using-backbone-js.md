# How can I prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when using Backbone.js?
// plain

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that can occur when using Backbone.js. To prevent XSS vulnerabilities, it is important to properly sanitize all user input. This can be done by using the `_.escape()` method, which will escape any HTML tags in the user input.

For example, if the user input is `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the `_.escape()` method will convert it to `&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;`:

```javascript
const userInput = '<script>alert("XSS")</script>';
const sanitizedInput = _.escape(userInput);
console.log(sanitizedInput);
```

## Output example

```
&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS")&lt;/script&gt;
```

The `_.escape()` method will also escape any characters that could be used to inject malicious scripts, such as `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `/`, and `=`.

Additionally, it is important to ensure that any user-generated content is properly encoded when being used in HTML. This can be done by using the `_.escape()` method when inserting user content into HTML.
