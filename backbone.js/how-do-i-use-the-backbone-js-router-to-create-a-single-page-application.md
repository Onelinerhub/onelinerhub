# How do I use the Backbone.js router to create a single-page application?
// plain

Backbone.js routers are used to create single-page applications (SPAs). A single-page application is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server.

The Backbone.js router provides methods for routing client-side pages, and connecting them to actions and events. It can also be used to update the browser's URL in response to the user's actions.

To use the Backbone.js router to create a single-page application, you can use the following code:

```javascript
// Create a new router instance
var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
    routes: {
        "": "index",
        "about": "about"
    },
    index: function() {
        // Render the index page
    },
    about: function() {
        // Render the about page
    }
});

// Create an instance of the router
var router = new AppRouter();

// Start monitoring hashchange events and dispatching routes
Backbone.history.start();
```

This code creates an instance of the Backbone.js router, and defines two routes: `""` and `"about"`. The `index` and `about` functions are called when the respective routes are triggered. Finally, `Backbone.history.start()` is used to start monitoring hashchange events and dispatching routes.

## Code explanation


- `AppRouter`: the router instance
- `routes`: a hash of routes and their associated functions
- `index`: a function that renders the index page
- `about`: a function that renders the about page
- `Backbone.history.start()`: a function that starts monitoring hashchange events and dispatching routes
