# How can I use Backbone.js with React to build a web application?
// plain

Backbone.js and React can be used together to build web applications by creating a single-page application (SPA). The React component will be responsible for rendering the data that is passed to it from the Backbone model. The Backbone model will be responsible for fetching the data from the server and then updating the React component when new data is available.

## Example code

```
// Backbone Model
var Model = Backbone.Model.extend({
  url: '/data'
});

// React Component
class Component extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.model = new Model();
    this.model.on('change', () => {
      this.setState({ data: this.model.get('data') });
    });
    this.model.fetch();
  }

  render() {
    return <div>{this.state.data}</div>;
  }
}
```

The code above creates a Backbone model for fetching data from the server and a React component for rendering the data. The React component will listen for changes to the model and update the state with the new data when it is available.

## Code explanation


1. `var Model = Backbone.Model.extend({url: '/data'});`: This line creates a Backbone model for fetching data from the server. The `url` property is set to the endpoint that will be used to fetch the data.

2. `class Component extends React.Component {...}`: This line creates a React component for rendering the data.

3. `this.model = new Model();`: This line creates an instance of the Backbone model.

4. `this.model.on('change', () => {...});`: This line adds an event listener to the model that will be triggered when the data is updated.

5. `this.model.fetch();`: This line fetches the data from the server.

6. `this.setState({ data: this.model.get('data') });`: This line sets the state of the React component with the data from the model.

7. `return <div>{this.state.data}</div>;`: This line renders the data from the state in the React component.
