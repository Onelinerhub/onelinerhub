# How can I use Backbone.js and Fresco Play to create interactive, hands-on answers?
// plain

Backbone.js and Fresco Play can be used together to create interactive, hands-on answers. To do this, you need to create a web application that utilizes the Backbone.js library and the Fresco Play API.

The Backbone.js library provides models, views, collections, and routers which allow developers to create single page web applications. By using models, views, and collections, developers can create a data structure that represents the interactive, hands-on answer.

The Fresco Play API can be used to access data and services from a Fresco Play server. This allows developers to create interactive experiences that use Fresco Play data.

For example, the following code uses the Backbone.js library and the Fresco Play API to create an interactive, hands-on 

```javascript
// Create a Backbone.js model to represent the interactive, hands-on answer
var AnswerModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
    url: 'https://fresco-play.com/api/answers'
});

// Create a Backbone.js view to render the interactive, hands-on answer
var AnswerView = Backbone.View.extend({
    render: function() {
        // Render the interactive, hands-on answer
    }
});

// Fetch the interactive, hands-on answer from the Fresco Play API
var answer = new AnswerModel();
answer.fetch();

// Render the interactive, hands-on answer
var answerView = new AnswerView({ model: answer });
answerView.render();
```

The code above creates a Backbone.js model and view to represent the interactive, hands-on answer. It then fetches the answer from the Fresco Play API and renders it using the Backbone.js view.

By combining Backbone.js and Fresco Play, developers can create interactive, hands-on answers for their users.

## Code explanation

- Create a Backbone.js model to represent the interactive, hands-on  `var AnswerModel = Backbone.Model.extend({ url: 'https://fresco-play.com/api/answers' });`
- Create a Backbone.js view to render the interactive, hands-on  `var AnswerView = Backbone.View.extend({ render: function() { // Render the interactive, hands-on answer } });`
- Fetch the interactive, hands-on answer from the Fresco Play API: `var answer = new AnswerModel(); answer.fetch();`
- Render the interactive, hands-on  `var answerView = new AnswerView({ model: answer }); answerView.render();`
