# How can I use Backbone.js to navigate a web application?
// plain

Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that can be used to create a single page web application. It provides a structure for the application with Models, Views, and Routers.

Models are used to store and retrieve data from the server, while Views are used to render the data in the browser. Routers are used to map URLs to specific actions and views.

Using Backbone.js, you can create a Router that will navigate your web application. For example, the following code will create a Router with two routes:

```
var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "home": "showHome",
    "about": "showAbout"
  },
  showHome: function(){
    // render the home page
  },
  showAbout: function(){
    // render the about page
  }
});

var router = new AppRouter();
Backbone.history.start();
```

When the Router is instantiated, it will listen for changes to the URL and call the appropriate methods. For example, when the URL changes to `/home`, the `showHome()` method will be called. Similarly, when the URL changes to `/about`, the `showAbout()` method will be called.

In addition to the Router, Backbone.js also provides a View class which can be used to render the HTML for each page. The View class can be used to handle events, such as a button click, and update the Model accordingly.
