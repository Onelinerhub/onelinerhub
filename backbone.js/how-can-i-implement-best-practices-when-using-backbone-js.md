1. **Use Modular Code:** Modular code helps to keep your code organized and easier to maintain. Break your code into separate modules and use `require.js` to manage dependencies.

2. **Use Views:** Views are a great way to keep your code organized and your data separate from your UI. Use `Backbone.View` to create views and avoid putting too much logic in your views.

3. **Use Models:** Models are a great way to store and manage data in Backbone.js. Use `Backbone.Model` to create models and `Backbone.Collection` to manage collections of models.

4. **Use Underscore Templating:** Use Underscore templating to separate your HTML from your JavaScript logic. This will make your code easier to maintain and more readable.

```
<script type="text/template" id="template-name">
  <div>
    <%= name %>
  </div>
</script>

<script>
  var template = _.template($('#template-name').html());
  var html = template({name: "John Doe"});
  $('#some-div').html(html);
</script>
```

## Output example

```
<div>John Doe</div>
```

5. **Use Events:** Events are a great way to decouple your code and keep your code organized. Use `Backbone.Events` to create and listen for events.

6. **Use Router:** Use `Backbone.Router` to create routes and manage the state of your application.

7. **Use AMD:** Use AMD to manage dependencies and keep your code organized.
