# How can I use Backbone.js and Fresco Play together in a software development project?
// plain

Backbone.js and Fresco Play can be used together in a software development project by taking advantage of the data binding capabilities of Backbone.js and the backend development capabilities of Fresco Play.

Backbone.js can be used to create the application's frontend, while Fresco Play can be used to create the backend. The data binding capabilities of Backbone.js can be used to bind the data from the backend to the frontend.

For example, the following code could be used to bind the data from a backend API call to a view in Backbone.js:

```javascript
// Create a new Backbone Model
var model = new Backbone.Model();

// Fetch data from the backend API
model.fetch({
    url: 'http://your-backend-api.com/data',
    success: function (model, response) {
        // Bind the data to the view
        view.model = model;
    }
});
```

## Code explanation


- `var model = new Backbone.Model();`: This creates a new Backbone Model.
- `model.fetch({ ... })`: This fetches data from the backend API.
- `view.model = model;`: This binds the data from the backend API to the view.
