# How do I use an if condition in Backbone.js?
// plain

In Backbone.js, you can use an `if` condition to control the flow of your code.

For example, if you want to check if a variable `x` is greater than 10, you can use the following code:
```
if (x > 10) {
  // do something
}
```
The code above will check if `x` is greater than 10. If it is, then the code inside the `if` block will be executed. Otherwise, the code inside the `if` block will be skipped.

You can also use `else` and `else if` statements to check for multiple conditions. For example:
```
if (x > 10) {
  // do something
} else if (x < 5) {
  // do something else
} else {
  // do something else
}
```
The code above will check if `x` is greater than 10. If it is, then the code inside the first `if` block will be executed. If `x` is less than 5, then the code inside the `else if` block will be executed. Otherwise, the code inside the `else` block will be executed.

## Code explanation

- `if`: Used to check a condition and execute code if the condition is true
- `else`: Used to execute code if the condition of the `if` statement is false
- `else if`: Used to check multiple conditions and execute code if the condition is true
