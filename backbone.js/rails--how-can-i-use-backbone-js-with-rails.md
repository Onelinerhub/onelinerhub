How can I use Backbone.js with Rails?
// plain

Backbone.js is a popular JavaScript library that can be used with Rails to create a single page application. It provides an MVC pattern to structure your code and allows for a more organized and efficient development process.

To use Backbone.js with Rails, you'll need to include the Backbone library in your application.js file.

```javascript
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require underscore
//= require backbone
//= require my_app
//= require_tree .
```

You'll also need to create a folder for your Backbone models, views, and collections. This folder should be placed inside the app/assets/javascripts directory.

Once the models, views, and collections have been created, you can use the Rails asset pipeline to compile them into a single JavaScript file. This file should be included in your application layout.

```html
<%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>
```

Finally, you'll need to create routes for your Backbone models, views, and collections. These routes should be placed in the routes.rb file.

```ruby
resources :models, only: [:index, :show]
resources :views, only: [:index, :show]
resources :collections, only: [:index, :show]
```

Once these steps are completed, you can use Backbone.js with Rails to create a single page application.
