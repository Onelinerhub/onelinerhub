# How do Backbone.js and Angular differ in terms of usage and features?
// plain

Backbone.js and Angular are both popular JavaScript frameworks that are used to build dynamic web applications. They differ in terms of usage and features.

Backbone.js is a lightweight library that provides structure to client-side applications. It is more focused on providing models and collections, and is better suited for smaller projects. It also provides a basic set of views and routers, but does not provide any templating or two-way data binding features.

Example code of Backbone.js:
```
var model = new Backbone.Model({
    name: 'John Doe'
});

console.log(model.get('name'));
```
## Output example

```
John Doe
```

Angular, on the other hand, is a full-fledged framework that provides a comprehensive set of features for building dynamic web applications. It provides two-way data binding, templating, dependency injection, and more. It is better suited for larger projects and provides a more robust set of features.

Example code of Angular:
```
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
    <p>{{name}}</p>
</div>

<script>
    angular.module('myApp', [])
        .controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
            $scope.name = 'John Doe';
        });
</script>
```
## Output example

```
John Doe
```

Overall, Backbone.js is more lightweight and is better suited for smaller projects, while Angular is a full-fledged framework that provides a comprehensive set of features for building dynamic web applications.
