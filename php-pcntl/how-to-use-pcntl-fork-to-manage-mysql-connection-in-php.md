# How to use PCNTL fork to manage MySQL connection in PHP?
// plain

PCNTL fork is a powerful tool for managing multiple MySQL connections in PHP. It allows for the creation of multiple processes that can run simultaneously.

## Example code

```
<?php
$pid = pcntl_fork();
if ($pid == -1) {
    die('could not fork');
} else if ($pid) {
    // parent process
    $db = new mysqli('localhost', 'username', 'password', 'database');
    // do something with the database
} else {
    // child process
    $db = new mysqli('localhost', 'username', 'password', 'database');
    // do something with the database
}
?>
```

The code above creates two processes, one for the parent and one for the child. The parent process creates a new MySQL connection and the child process creates a new MySQL connection. Both processes can then use the MySQL connection to perform operations.

## Code explanation


1. `$pid = pcntl_fork();` - This line creates a new process using the PCNTL fork function.

2. `if ($pid == -1) {` - This line checks if the process was created successfully. If the process was not created successfully, an error message is displayed.

3. `else if ($pid) {` - This line checks if the process is the parent process. If it is, a new MySQL connection is created.

4. `else {` - This line checks if the process is the child process. If it is, a new MySQL connection is created.

5. `// do something with the database` - This line is used to perform operations on the MySQL connection.
