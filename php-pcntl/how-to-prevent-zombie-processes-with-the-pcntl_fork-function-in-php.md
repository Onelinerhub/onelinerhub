# How to prevent zombie processes with the PCNTL_FORK function in PHP?
// plain

The PCNTL_FORK function in PHP can be used to prevent zombie processes. It allows a process to fork itself into two separate processes, one of which is the parent process and the other is the child process. The parent process can then monitor the child process and take appropriate action if it terminates unexpectedly.

## Example code

```
<?php
$pid = pcntl_fork();
if ($pid == -1) {
    die('could not fork');
} else if ($pid) {
    // parent process
    pcntl_wait($status); //Protect against Zombie children
} else {
    // child process
    // do something
    exit();
}
```

## Output example

```
none
```

## Code explanation

- `$pid = pcntl_fork();`: This line forks the current process into two separate processes, one of which is the parent process and the other is the child process.
- `if ($pid == -1) {`: This line checks if the fork was successful. If it was not, it will die with an error message.
- `pcntl_wait($status);`: This line is used by the parent process to wait for the child process to finish. This prevents the child process from becoming a zombie process.
- `exit();`: This line is used by the child process to exit gracefully.
