Lib of well explained and minimalistic code solutions @ [onelinerhub.com](https://onelinerhub.com/)

## Quick links
- [How to contribute](/how-to-contribute.md)
- [API Docs](/api.md)
- [Latest updates](https://onelinerhub.com/fresh)
- [List of all technologies](https://onelinerhub.com/techs)

## Why we do it and where we go
- clear simple modern solutions for repeatable coding problems
- moderated single-standard solutions instead of "here's a list of 25 answers with 125 comments"
- code parts explanations to fight dumb copy-paste, but educate instead

## Principles
- 3 main principles for code pieces here are: simple, modern, minimal
- Micro solutions are meant to solve specific issue in **modern** versions of technologies (browsers, compilers, databases, etc.)
- Solution should be as short and simple as possible
- Solution should be explained by components (variables, functions, operations, etc.)
- Image illustrations are welcome
