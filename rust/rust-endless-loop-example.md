# Rust endless loop example
// plain

An endless loop in Rust is a loop that never ends. It is created by using the `loop` keyword. The following example code will create an endless loop:

```
loop {
    println!("This is an endless loop!");
}
```

The output of this code will be:
```
This is an endless loop!
This is an endless loop!
This is an endless loop!
...
```

The code consists of the following parts:
- `loop` keyword: This keyword is used to create an endless loop.
- `{ }`: This is the body of the loop, which contains the code that will be executed in the loop.
