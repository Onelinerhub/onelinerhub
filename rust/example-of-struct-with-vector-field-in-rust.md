# Example of struct with vector field in Rust
// plain

A `struct` with a `vector` field in Rust can be defined as follows:

```rust
struct VectorStruct {
    vector: Vec<i32>,
}
```

This `struct` contains a single field, `vector`, which is a `Vec` type containing `i32` values.

## Code explanation


1. `struct VectorStruct` - defines a new `struct` called `VectorStruct`
2. `vector: Vec<i32>` - defines a field called `vector` of type `Vec` containing `i32` values
