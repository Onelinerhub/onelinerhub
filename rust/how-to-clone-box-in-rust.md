# How to clone box in Rust
// plain

Cloning a box in Rust is a simple process. It can be done using the `clone()` method. The syntax is as follows:
```rust
let cloned_box = my_box.clone();
```
This will create a new box with the same contents as the original.

The `clone()` method has the following parts:
- `my_box`: The original box to be cloned.
- `clone()`: The method used to clone the box.
- `cloned_box`: The new box created with the same contents as the original.

For more information, see the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.clone).
