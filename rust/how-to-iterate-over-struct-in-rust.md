# How to iterate over struct in Rust
// plain

Iterating over a struct in Rust is done using a `for` loop. The syntax is as follows:

```
for element in struct {
    // code to execute
}
```

## Code explanation


- `for`: the keyword used to start the loop
- `element`: the variable used to store each element of the struct
- `in`: the keyword used to indicate the struct to iterate over
- `struct`: the name of the struct to iterate over
- `{`: the opening brace of the loop
- `// code to execute`: the code to execute for each element of the struct
- `}`: the closing brace of the loop
