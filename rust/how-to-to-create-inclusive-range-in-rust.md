# How to to create inclusive range in Rust?
// plain

Creating inclusive range in Rust is easy and straightforward. The `..=` operator is used to create an inclusive range. For example:

```
let range = 0..=10;
```

This creates a range from 0 to 10, including both 0 and 10.

## Code explanation


1. `let range = 0..=10;` - This creates a variable called `range` and assigns it a range from 0 to 10, including both 0 and 10.

2. `..=` - This is the operator used to create an inclusive range.
