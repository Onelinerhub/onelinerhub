# How do I declare a variable without initializing it in Rust?
// plain

A variable in Rust can be declared without initializing it. This is done by using the `let` keyword followed by the variable name.

```rust
let x;
```

This will declare a variable `x` without initializing it.

- `let`: keyword used to declare a variable
- `x`: name of the variable
