# How to use if let in Rust
// plain

If let is a control flow construct in Rust that allows you to conditionally execute a block of code based on the result of an expression. It is similar to an if statement, but it allows you to assign the result of the expression to a variable within the same scope. To use if let, you must provide an expression followed by the keyword let, followed by a pattern. The code block will be executed if the expression evaluates to a value that matches the pattern. For example:
```
let some_option = Some(5);

if let Some(value) = some_option {
    println!("The value is {}", value);
}
```
In this example, the expression is `some_option` and the pattern is `Some(value)`. If the expression evaluates to a value that matches the pattern, the code block will be executed and the value will be assigned to the variable `value`. The output of this code would be:
```
The value is 5
```
If let is a useful tool for writing concise code that is easy to read and understand. It can be used to match patterns in data structures, such as Option and Result, and to handle errors in a more concise way.
