# How do I declare multiple variables in Rust?
// plain

You can declare multiple variables in Rust using the `let` keyword. For example:

```
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = 15;
```

This will create three variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`, each with the corresponding values.

You can also declare multiple variables in one line, like this:

```
let x = 5, y = 10, z = 15;
```

This will create the same three variables as before.

You can also declare multiple variables of the same type in one line, like this:

```
let x = 5, y = 10, z = 15;
let a = 20, b = 25, c = 30;
```

This will create six variables, `x`, `y`, `z`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, each with the corresponding values.
