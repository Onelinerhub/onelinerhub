# How to add comments to struct in Rust
// plain

Comments can be added to structs in Rust using the `//` syntax. For example:

```
struct Person {
    name: String, // Name of the person
    age: u8, // Age of the person
}
```

The `//` syntax allows for comments to be added after the field declaration. This is useful for providing additional information about the field, such as its purpose or expected values.

## Code explanation


- `struct Person`: This declares a struct named `Person`.
- `name: String`: This declares a field named `name` of type `String`.
- `age: u8`: This declares a field named `age` of type `u8`.
- `// Name of the person`: This is a comment that provides additional information about the `name` field.
- `// Age of the person`: This is a comment that provides additional information about the `age` field.
