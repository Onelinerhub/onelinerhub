# What is the default value of a Rust string?
// plain

The default value of a Rust string is an empty string. This is represented by two double quotes with nothing in between, like this: `""`.

```rust
let my_string = "";
println!("{}", my_string);
```

## Output example

```

```

The empty string is a valid string, and can be used in the same way as any other string.

## Code explanation


1. `let my_string = "";` - This line declares a variable called `my_string` and assigns it the value of an empty string.
2. `println!("{}", my_string);` - This line prints the value of `my_string` to the console.
