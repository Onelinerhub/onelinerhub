# Rust null string example
// plain

A Rust null string is a string that has a length of zero. It is represented by a double quotation mark with nothing in between.

## Example code

```
let s = "";
println!("{}", s.len());
```

## Output example

```
0
```

The code above creates a string `s` with nothing in between the double quotation marks. The `len()` method is then used to print the length of the string, which is 0.
