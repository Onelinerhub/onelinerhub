# How do I define a variable in Rust?
// plain

A variable in Rust is a way to store a value in memory. Variables are declared using the `let` keyword, followed by the variable name and a type annotation.

```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
```

The code above declares a variable `x` of type `i32` and assigns it the value `5`.

- `let`: keyword used to declare a variable
- `x`: name of the variable
- `: i32`: type annotation
- `= 5`: value assigned to the variable
