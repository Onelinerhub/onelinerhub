# Rust struct without fields
// plain

A Rust struct without fields is a struct that does not contain any data. It is useful for creating a type that can be used in generic programming.

## Example code

```rust
struct EmptyStruct;
```

This code creates an empty struct named `EmptyStruct`.

## Code explanation

- `struct`: The keyword used to declare a struct in Rust.
- `EmptyStruct`: The name of the struct being declared.
