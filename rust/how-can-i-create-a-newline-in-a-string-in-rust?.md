# How can I create a newline in a string in Rust?
// plain

Creating a newline in a string in Rust is done using the `\n` escape sequence. For example:

```
let my_string = "This is the first line\nThis is the second line";
```

This will output:

```
This is the first line
This is the second line
```

## Code explanation


- `let`: This is a keyword used to declare a variable.
- `my_string`: This is the name of the variable.
- `"This is the first line\nThis is the second line"`: This is the string assigned to the variable. The `\n` is the escape sequence used to create a newline.
