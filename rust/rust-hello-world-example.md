# Rust Hello World example 
// plain

This is a simple example of a "Hello World" program written in Rust.

```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Output example

```
Hello, world!
```

The code consists of two parts:

1. The `fn main()` function: This is the entry point of the program. All Rust programs must have a `main` function.

2. The `println!` macro: This macro prints a string to the console. The `!` indicates that it is a macro, not a function.
