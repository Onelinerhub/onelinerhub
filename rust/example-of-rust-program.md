# Example of Rust program
// plain

This is an example of a Rust program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Output example

```
Hello, World!
```

This program consists of a single function, `main()`, which is the entry point of the program. The `println!` macro prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Code explanation

- `fn main()`: This is the function declaration, which declares the `main()` function.
- `println!`: This is a macro that prints a string to the console.
- `"Hello, World!"`: This is the string that is printed to the console.
