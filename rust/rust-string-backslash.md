# rust string backslash
// plain

A backslash (`\`) is a special character in Rust strings that can be used to escape certain characters. For example, if you want to include a double quote (`"`) in a string, you can use a backslash to escape it.

## Example code

```rust
let my_string = "This is a string with a \"double quote\" in it";
```

## Output example

```
This is a string with a "double quote" in it
```

## Code explanation

- `let`: This is a keyword used to declare a variable.
- `my_string`: This is the name of the variable being declared.
- `"This is a string with a \"double quote\" in it"`: This is the string being assigned to the variable. The backslash (`\`) is used to escape the double quote (`"`) so that it is included in the string.
