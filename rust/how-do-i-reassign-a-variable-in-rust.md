# How do I reassign a variable in Rust?
// plain

You can reassign a variable in Rust by using the `let` keyword. For example:

```
let mut x = 5;
x = 10;
```

This code will reassign the value of `x` from `5` to `10`. The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable, and the `mut` keyword is used to make the variable mutable, meaning it can be changed.

- `let`: declares a variable
- `mut`: makes the variable mutable
