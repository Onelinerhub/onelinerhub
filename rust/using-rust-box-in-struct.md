# Using Rust box in struct
// plain

Rust box in struct is a way to store data in a struct. It allows for the storage of any type of data, including references, in a single struct. This is useful for when you need to store multiple types of data in a single struct.

Example code:
```rust
struct MyStruct {
    data: Box<dyn Any>,
}

fn main() {
    let my_struct = MyStruct {
        data: Box::new(42),
    };
}
```

Output:
```
MyStruct { data: Box(42) }
```

Code parts with detailed explanation:

- `struct MyStruct`: This is the struct that will contain the data.
- `data: Box<dyn Any>`: This is the field that will store the data. The `Box` type is used to store the data in the struct. The `dyn Any` type is used to allow for any type of data to be stored in the struct.
- `Box::new(42)`: This is the data that will be stored in the struct. In this example, the data is an integer with the value of 42.
