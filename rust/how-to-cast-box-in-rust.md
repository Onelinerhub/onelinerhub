# How to cast box in Rust
// plain

Casting in Rust is the process of converting a value of one type to another type. This can be done using the `as` keyword.

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x as i32;
```

The above code will convert the value of `x` from an `i32` to an `i32`. The output of the code will be:

```
5
```

The code consists of the following parts:

- `let x = 5;` - This declares a variable `x` with the value `5`.
- `let y = x as i32;` - This casts the value of `x` from an `i32` to an `i32`.
