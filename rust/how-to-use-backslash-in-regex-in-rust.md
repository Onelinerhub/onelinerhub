# How to use backslash in regex in Rust?
// plain

Using backslash in regex in Rust is quite simple. The backslash character is used to escape special characters in regex. For example, the following code block will match the string `\d`:
```rust
let re = Regex::new(r"\\d").unwrap();
assert!(re.is_match("\\d"));
```

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. `let re = Regex::new(r"\\d").unwrap();` - This line creates a new Regex object from the given string. The `r` before the string indicates that the string is a raw string, which means that the backslash character is not treated as an escape character.

2. `assert!(re.is_match("\\d"));` - This line checks if the given string matches the regex. Since the regex is `\\d`, it will match the string `\d`.

For more information about using backslash in regex in Rust, please refer to the [Rust Regex documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/regex/index.html).
