# How do I bind a variable in Rust?
// plain

Variables in Rust are immutable by default, meaning they cannot be changed once they are declared. To bind a variable, you must use the `let` keyword. This will create a new variable and assign it a value.

```rust
let x = 5;
```

This code will create a new variable `x` and assign it the value `5`.

- `let`: keyword used to create a new variable
- `x`: name of the variable
- `=`: assignment operator
- `5`: value assigned to the variable
