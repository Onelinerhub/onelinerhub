# How do I delete a character from a Rust string?
// plain

You can delete a character from a Rust string using the `.remove(start_index)` method. This method takes the index of the character to be removed as an argument.

For example:
```
let mut my_string = String::from("Hello World!");
my_string.remove(6);
println!("{}", my_string);
```
This will output `HelloWold!`.

The code works as follows:
- `let mut my_string = String::from("Hello World!");`: This creates a mutable string with the value `Hello World!`.
- `my_string.remove(6);`: This calls the `remove` method on the string, passing in the index of the character to be removed (in this case, 6, which is the space between `Hello` and `World`).
- `println!("{}", my_string);`: This prints the modified string to the console.

For more information, see the [Rust documentation on strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html).
