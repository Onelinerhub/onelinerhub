# What type of variable declaration is used in Rust?
// plain

Rust uses a type of variable declaration called a `let` statement. This statement is used to declare a variable and assign it a value. For example, the following code declares a variable `x` and assigns it the value `5`:

```
let x = 5;
```

The code consists of three parts:

1. The keyword `let`, which is used to declare a variable.
2. The variable name `x`, which is used to refer to the variable.
3. The value `5`, which is assigned to the variable.

Variables declared with `let` are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed once they are declared.

For more information about variable declarations in Rust, see the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html).
