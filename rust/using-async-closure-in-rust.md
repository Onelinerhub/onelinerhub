# Using async closure in Rust
// plain

Async closures in Rust allow you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style. This is done by using the async keyword to create an async closure, which is a function that returns a Future. The Future is a type that represents a value that will be available at some point in the future. The async closure can then be used to perform asynchronous operations, such as making an HTTP request or waiting for a timer to expire. The code inside the async closure will be executed asynchronously, and the result will be returned as a Future. An example of an async closure is shown below:
```
async fn example() {
    let result = async {
        // Perform some asynchronous operation
    };
    result.await
}
```
In this example, the async closure is used to perform an asynchronous operation, and the result is returned as a Future. The await keyword is used to wait for the Future to resolve before continuing execution. This allows asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style, making it easier to read and maintain.
