# How do I create a variable in Rust?
// plain

Creating a variable in Rust is a simple process. You can use the `let` keyword to declare a variable and assign it a value. For example:
```
let x = 5;
```
This code creates a variable called `x` and assigns it the value `5`.

The parts of this code are:
- `let`: the keyword used to declare a variable
- `x`: the name of the variable
- `=`: the assignment operator
- `5`: the value assigned to the variable

You can also declare a variable without assigning it a value. In this case, the variable will be given a default value depending on its type. For example:
```
let y: i32;
```
This code creates a variable called `y` of type `i32` and assigns it the default value `0`.
