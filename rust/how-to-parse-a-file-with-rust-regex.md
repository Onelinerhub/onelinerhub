# How to parse a file with Rust regex?
// plain

Parsing a file with Rust regex is a powerful way to extract data from a file. The `regex` crate provides a powerful set of tools for matching and extracting data from strings.

## Example code

```rust
use regex::Regex;

let re = Regex::new(r"\d+").unwrap();
let text = "The answer is 42";

for cap in re.captures_iter(text) {
    println!("{}", &cap[0]);
}
```

## Output example

```
42
```

The code above uses the `Regex::new` function to create a new Regex object from a string. The `captures_iter` method is then used to iterate over all the matches in the string. The `&cap[0]` expression is used to access the matched string.

## Code explanation


- `Regex::new`: This function creates a new Regex object from a string.
- `captures_iter`: This method is used to iterate over all the matches in the string.
- `&cap[0]`: This expression is used to access the matched string.
