# How do I initialize a variable in Rust?
// plain

Variables in Rust are declared using the `let` keyword. The syntax for initializing a variable is `let <variable_name> = <value>`. For example:
```
let x = 5;
```
This will create a variable named `x` and assign it the value `5`.

The parts of the code are:
- `let`: the keyword used to declare a variable
- `x`: the name of the variable
- `=`: the assignment operator
- `5`: the value assigned to the variable

More information about variables in Rust can be found in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html).
