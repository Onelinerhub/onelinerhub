# How do I create a binary variable in Rust?
// plain

Creating a binary variable in Rust is easy. All you need to do is declare a variable of type `bool` and assign it a value of `true` or `false`. For example:

```rust
let binary_variable: bool = true;
```

This will create a binary variable called `binary_variable` with a value of `true`.

## Code explanation


1. `let` - the keyword used to declare a variable
2. `binary_variable` - the name of the variable
3. `: bool` - the type of the variable, in this case a boolean
4. `= true` - the value assigned to the variable, in this case `true`
