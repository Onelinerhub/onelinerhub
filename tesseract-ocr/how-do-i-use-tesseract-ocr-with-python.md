# How do I use tesseract OCR with Python?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine that can be used with Python. It can be used to extract text from images and scanned documents.

To use Tesseract OCR with Python, you will need to install the pytesseract package. This can be done using pip:

```
pip install pytesseract
```

Once the package is installed, you can use the pytesseract.image_to_string() function to extract text from an image. For example:

```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

image = Image.open('example.png')
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
print(text)
```

The output of the above code might look something like this:

```
This is an example image.
```

The code consists of the following parts:

- `import pytesseract`: Imports the pytesseract module.
- `from PIL import Image`: Imports the Image module from the Pillow library.
- `image = Image.open('example.png')`: Opens the example.png image and assigns it to the `image` variable.
- `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)`: Uses the pytesseract.image_to_string() function to extract text from the `image` variable.
- `print(text)`: Prints the extracted text.
