Tesseract OCR is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool that can be used to extract text from PDFs. It is a free and open-source software available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

To use Tesseract OCR to extract text from a PDF, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Install Tesseract OCR on your system.
2. Convert the PDF into an image file (e.g. .png or .jpg).
3. Use the Tesseract OCR command line tool to extract text from the image.

## Example code

```
tesseract input_image.png output_text.txt
```

This command will create a text file called output_text.txt that contains the extracted text.

## Code explanation


* tesseract: the Tesseract OCR command line tool
* input_image.png: the image file from which text should be extracted
* output_text.txt: the output text file that will contain the extracted text
