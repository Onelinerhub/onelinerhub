# How can I use Tesseract OCR to read text from Reddit posts?
// plain

You can use Tesseract OCR to read text from Reddit posts by first extracting the post content from the Reddit API. Then you can use the pytesseract library to read the text from the post.

## Example code

```
# Import libraries
import requests
import pytesseract

# Get post content from Reddit API
r = requests.get('https://www.reddit.com/r/example/comments/example/.json')
post_content = r.json()['data']['children'][0]['data']['selftext']

# Read text from post content
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(post_content)

# Print text
print(text)
```

## Output example

```
This is an example post.
```

## Code explanation

1. `import requests`: imports the requests library which is used to retrieve the post content from the Reddit API.
2. `import pytesseract`: imports the pytesseract library which is used to read the text from the post content.
3. `r = requests.get('https://www.reddit.com/r/example/comments/example/.json')`: retrieves the post content from the Reddit API.
4. `post_content = r.json()['data']['children'][0]['data']['selftext']`: extracts the post content from the Reddit API response.
5. `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(post_content)`: reads the text from the post content using the pytesseract library.
6. `print(text)`: prints the text from the post content.
