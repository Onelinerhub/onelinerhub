// plain

Tesseract-ocr-jpn is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) library developed by Google that can be used to recognize and extract text from Japanese images. To use tesseract-ocr-jpn to perform optical character recognition in Japanese, you need to install the library, set up the environment, and then use the library's API to recognize the text.

1. Install the library:

```
$ pip install tesseract-ocr-jpn
```

2. Set up the environment:

```
$ export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/local/share/tessdata
```

3. Use the library's API to recognize the text:

```
from tesseract_ocr_jpn import TesseractOCRJPN

image_file = 'japanese_image.jpg'

ocr = TesseractOCRJPN()
text = ocr.recognize(image_file)

print(text)
```

## Output example

```
今日は晴れです。
```

The above example code uses the TesseractOCRJPN() class to recognize the text in the 'japanese_image.jpg' file. The output is the recognized Japanese text: "今日は晴れです。"
