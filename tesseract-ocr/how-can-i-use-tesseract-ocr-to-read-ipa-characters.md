# How can I use Tesseract OCR to read IPA characters?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source optical character recognition library that can be used to read IPA characters. To use Tesseract OCR to read IPA characters, you will need to first install the library on your machine. Once the library is installed, you can use the following code to read IPA characters:

```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# Path of the image containing the IPA characters
image_path = "path/to/image.png"

# Read the image
image = Image.open(image_path)

# Extract the text from the image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

# Print the text
print(text)
```

This code will print the extracted text from the image of the IPA characters.

Parts of the code:
1. `import pytesseract`: This statement imports the `pytesseract` module which is used to access the Tesseract OCR library.
2. `from PIL import Image`: This statement imports the `Image` class from the `PIL` module which is used to open the image containing the IPA characters.
3. `image_path = "path/to/image.png"`: This statement defines the path of the image containing the IPA characters.
4. `image = Image.open(image_path)`: This statement opens the image using the `Image` class.
5. `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)`: This statement uses the `image_to_string` method of the `pytesseract` module to extract the text from the image.
6. `print(text)`: This statement prints the extracted text.
