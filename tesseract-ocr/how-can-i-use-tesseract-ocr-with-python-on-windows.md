Tesseract OCR is a popular open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine, and can be used with Python on Windows. To use Tesseract OCR with Python, you will need to install the Tesseract OCR and pytesseract packages.

To install Tesseract OCR on Windows, you can download the executable installer from [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). After installation, you will need to add the Tesseract executable to your PATH environment variable.

To install pytesseract, you can use `pip`:
```
pip install pytesseract
```

Once you have both packages installed, you can use the following code snippet to recognize text in an image using Tesseract OCR with Python:
```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"

image = Image.open('image.png')
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
print(text)
```

The code consists of the following parts:
* `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd`: This sets the path of the Tesseract executable.
* `Image.open('image.png')`: This opens the image file.
* `pytesseract.image_to_string(image)`: This runs Tesseract OCR on the image and returns the recognized text.
* `print(text)`: This prints the recognized text.

For more information on how to use Tesseract OCR with Python, please refer to the [pytesseract documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/).
