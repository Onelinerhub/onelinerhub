# How can I use Tesseract OCR to recognize handwriting?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source tool for recognizing text from images. It can be used to recognize handwriting as well. Here is an example of how to use Tesseract OCR to recognize handwriting:

```
# import the necessary packages
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# load the example image and convert it to grayscale
image = Image.open('handwriting.png').convert('L')

# run tesseract, recognizing the handwritten text
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

# print the recognized text
print(text)
```

## Output example

```
This is some handwriting
```

The code above:
1. Imports the necessary packages for Tesseract OCR.
2. Loads the example image and converts it to grayscale.
3. Runs Tesseract OCR to recognize the handwritten text.
4. Prints the recognized text.
