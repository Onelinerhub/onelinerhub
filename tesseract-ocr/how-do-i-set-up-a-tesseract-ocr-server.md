// plain

Setting up a Tesseract OCR server requires several steps.

1. Install Tesseract OCR library. This can be done with the command:
```
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

2. Install a language package for Tesseract. This can be done with the command:
```
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-<lang>
```
Where `<lang>` is the language package you wish to install.

3. Create a folder to store your images. This can be done with the command:
```
mkdir /path/to/images
```

4. Copy your images into the folder you created in step 3.

5. Run Tesseract on the images. This can be done with the command:
```
tesseract /path/to/images/<image>.png /path/to/output
```
Where `<image>` is the name of the image you wish to process.

6. Install a web server to host the Tesseract OCR server. This can be done with the command:
```
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

7. Configure the web server to run Tesseract OCR. This can be done by following the instructions on [this page](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/API).
