# How does tesseract OCR work?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an optical character recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google. It is an open source library that can be used to extract text from images. It works by analyzing the image pixel by pixel and then recognizing patterns in the image that correspond to letters or numbers.

For example, the following code block will extract text from a given image:
```
from PIL import Image
from pytesseract import image_to_string

img = Image.open('image.jpg')
text = image_to_string(img)
print(text)
```
## Output example

```
This is some text in an image.
```

The code consists of the following parts:
1. Import the Python Image Library (PIL) and pytesseract library.
2. Load the image using the Image.open() function.
3. Apply the image_to_string() function to the image to extract the text.
4. Print the extracted text.

The Tesseract OCR engine works by first pre-processing the image, such as converting it to grayscale, removing noise, and enhancing the image. Then the engine uses a set of algorithms to identify patterns in the image that correspond to letters or numbers. Finally, the engine outputs the recognized text.
