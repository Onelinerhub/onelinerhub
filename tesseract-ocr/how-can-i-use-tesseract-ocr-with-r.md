# How can I use Tesseract OCR with R?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine. It can be used with R to extract text from images.

To use Tesseract OCR with R, you need to install the [tesseract package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tesseract/index.html) from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). This package provides a wrapper for the `tesseract` command line tool.

Once the `tesseract` package is installed, you can use the `tesseract` function to extract text from an image. For example, the following code block can be used to extract text from an image file named `example.jpg`:

```
library(tesseract)
text <- tesseract::ocr("example.jpg")
text
```

The output of the code block will be the extracted text from the image, which will look something like this:

```
This is an example image.
```

The `tesseract` function also supports a variety of options for customizing the OCR process. For example, you can specify the language of the text in the image, the page segmentation mode, the engine mode, and more.

For more information, you can refer to the [tesseract package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tesseract/vignettes/tesseract_vignette.html).
