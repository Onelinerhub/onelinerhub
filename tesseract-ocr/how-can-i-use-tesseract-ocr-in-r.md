# How can I use Tesseract OCR in R?
// plain

Tesseract OCR can be used in R using the `tesseract` package. To install the package, run the following code in the R console:
```
install.packages("tesseract")
```

The package provides a wrapper for the Tesseract library, which can be used to extract text from images. To use the Tesseract library in R, the following code can be used:
```
library(tesseract)
text <- ocr("image.png")
print(text)
```
This code will extract the text from the image file `image.png` and print it to the console.

The `tesseract` package also provides a number of other functions for working with Tesseract, such as `ocr_data`, which can be used to extract text from a data frame, and `ocr_coordinates`, which can be used to extract text from a specific region of an image.
