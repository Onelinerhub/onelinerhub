# How do I configure Tesseract OCR?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. It can be used to recognize text in images. To configure Tesseract OCR, the following steps should be followed:

1. **Install Tesseract**: Tesseract OCR can be installed on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It can be installed using package managers such as apt-get, Homebrew, and Chocolatey.

2. **Download the language data**: Tesseract OCR supports over 100 languages. The language data can be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata).

3. **Set the language**: The language data needs to be set in the Tesseract configuration file. This can be done by setting the `tessedit_ocr_engine_mode` configuration option in the `tesseract.conf` file.

4. **Set the image type**: Tesseract OCR supports various image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP. The image type needs to be set in the Tesseract configuration file. This can be done by setting the `tessedit_pageseg_mode` configuration option in the `tesseract.conf` file.

5. **Run Tesseract**: The Tesseract OCR engine can be run from the command line. The following example shows how to run Tesseract on an image file:

```
$ tesseract image.png output
```

This will generate a text file named `output.txt` with the recognized text.

6. **Check the output**: The output of Tesseract OCR can be checked by opening the generated text file.

7. **Improve accuracy**: The accuracy of Tesseract OCR can be improved by using various techniques such as pre-processing the image, using different language data, and using different image types.
