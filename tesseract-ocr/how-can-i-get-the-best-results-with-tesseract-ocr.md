# How can I get the best results with Tesseract OCR?
// plain

The best results with Tesseract OCR can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Preprocessing: Preprocess the image to make the text easier for Tesseract OCR to detect. This can include using binarization (converting an image to black and white) or deskewing (straightening the lines of text in an image).

2. Training: Train Tesseract OCR with a language data file. This file should contain a list of words and their corresponding characters.

3. Running: Run Tesseract OCR on the preprocessed image.

## Example code

```
# Preprocess the image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
img_binarized = binarize(img)
img_deskewed = deskew(img_binarized)

# Train Tesseract OCR
tesseract.train('language-data.txt')

# Run Tesseract OCR
text = tesseract.run(img_deskewed)
```

## Output example

```
Text detected from the image:
This is some text in an image.
```
