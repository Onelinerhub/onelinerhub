1. **Improve Tesseract OCR Training Data**

The accuracy of Tesseract OCR can be improved by providing it with better training data. This can be done by creating a custom training dataset that contains samples of the type of text you want to recognize. The training dataset should include a variety of fonts, sizes, and styles.

2. **Adjust Tesseract OCR Parameters**

Tesseract OCR has several parameters that can be adjusted to improve its accuracy. These parameters include the threshold, page segmentation mode, and language.

3. **Pre-process Images**

Pre-processing images can also help improve the accuracy of Tesseract OCR. This includes techniques such as image binarization, deskewing, noise removal, and contrast adjustment.

4. **Example Code Block**

```python
import cv2
import pytesseract

# Read the image
img = cv2.imread('image.png')

# Pre-process the image
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]

# Run Tesseract OCR
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(thresh, lang='eng', config='--psm 6')

# Print the recognized text
print(text)
```

5. **Code Parts Explanation**
- `cv2.imread('image.png')`: Reads the image from the file.
- `cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`: Converts the image to grayscale.
- `cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]`: Applies a threshold to the image to binarize it.
- `pytesseract.image_to_string(thresh, lang='eng', config='--psm 6')`: Runs Tesseract OCR on the image.
- `print(text)`: Prints the recognized text.
