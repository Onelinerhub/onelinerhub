# How can I use Tesseract OCR in a web application?
// plain

To use Tesseract OCR in a web application, you need to first install the Tesseract OCR library. You can do this by using the command `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr` on Ubuntu, or `brew install tesseract` on Mac.

Once the library is installed, you can use the Tesseract OCR library in your web application by utilizing the Tesseract API. An example of this is shown below:

```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# Path to the image
img = Image.open("image.png")

# Use Tesseract to extract the text from the image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)

print(text)
```

This code would output the text extracted from the image.

## Code explanation

1. `import pytesseract`: This imports the Tesseract library.
2. `from PIL import Image`: This imports the Python Imaging Library (PIL) which is used to open the image.
3. `img = Image.open("image.png")`: This opens the image file.
4. `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)`: This uses the Tesseract library to extract the text from the image.
5. `print(text)`: This prints the text extracted from the image.
