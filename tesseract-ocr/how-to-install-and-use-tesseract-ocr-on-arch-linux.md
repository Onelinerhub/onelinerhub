# How to install and use Tesseract OCR on Arch Linux?
// plain

1. Install Tesseract OCR on Arch Linux:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S tesseract
   ```
2. Install the language data package you need:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S tesseract-data-<lang>
   ```
   Replace `<lang>` with the language you need, for example `eng`.
3. Test the installation by running Tesseract on an image:
   ```
   tesseract <image_file> <output_file>
   ```
   This will produce an output file containing the text extracted from the image.
4. To use Tesseract with other languages, specify the language code as an argument:
   ```
   tesseract <image_file> <output_file> -l <lang>
   ```
   Replace `<lang>` with the language code you need.
5. To get better accuracy, you can also specify the page segmentation mode:
   ```
   tesseract <image_file> <output_file> -psm <mode>
   ```
   Replace `<mode>` with the page segmentation mode you need.
6. To use Tesseract with other languages, you can also specify a custom config file:
   ```
   tesseract <image_file> <output_file> -c <config_file>
   ```
   Replace `<config_file>` with the path to the config file.
