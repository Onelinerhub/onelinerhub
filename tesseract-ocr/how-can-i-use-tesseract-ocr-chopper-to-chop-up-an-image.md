# How can I use Tesseract OCR Chopper to chop up an image?
// plain

Tesseract OCR Chopper is an open source library that can be used to chop up an image into smaller pieces. Here is an example code block that can be used to chop up an image:

```
from tesseract_ocr_chopper import chop_image

# Load image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

# Chop image into smaller pieces
pieces = chop_image(image)

# Loop through pieces
for piece in pieces:
    # Do something with the pieces
    pass
```

This code will chop up the image into smaller pieces and store them in the `pieces` variable. Each piece is a NumPy array representing the image data.

The code can also be further customized to specify the size of the pieces and the type of chop (e.g. vertical or horizontal). For more information, please refer to the [Tesseract OCR Chopper documentation](https://github.com/jflesch/tesseract_ocr_chopper/blob/master/README.md).
