# How can I use tesseract OCR with Python to process a video?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is a powerful open source tool for recognizing text from images and videos. It can be used with Python to process video files. Here is an example of how to use it:

```
# import the necessary packages
from pytesseract import Output
import pytesseract
import cv2

# load the video
video = cv2.VideoCapture('video.mp4')

# loop over the frames of the video
while True:
	# grab the current frame
	(grabbed, frame) = video.read()

	# if the frame could not be grabbed, then we have reached the end of the video
	if not grabbed:
		break

	# pass the frame through the OCR
	text = pytesseract.image_to_string(frame, config='--psm 6')
	print(text)

# release the video file pointer
video.release()
```

This code will loop through the frames of the video and pass them through the OCR to detect any text. The output of this code will be all the text that is detected in the frames of the video.

Parts of the code:

* `from pytesseract import Output` - imports the Output module from the pytesseract library.
* `import pytesseract` - imports the pytesseract library.
* `import cv2` - imports the OpenCV library.
* `video = cv2.VideoCapture('video.mp4')` - loads the video file.
* `(grabbed, frame) = video.read()` - reads the next frame from the video.
* `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(frame, config='--psm 6')` - passes the frame through the OCR.
* `print(text)` - prints the output of the OCR.
* `video.release()` - releases the video file pointer.
