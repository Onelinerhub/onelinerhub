# How can I use Tesseract OCR with Kubernetes?
// plain

Tesseract OCR can be used with Kubernetes by setting up a Tesseract Pod on the Kubernetes cluster. This will allow Tesseract to be used as a service within the cluster.

The following example code block will create a Tesseract Pod on a Kubernetes cluster:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: tesseract
spec:
  containers:
    - name: tesseract
      image: tesseract
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

This code will create a Pod named 'tesseract' using the tesseract image. The Pod will expose port 8080, which can be used for communication with the Tesseract service.

Once the Pod is created, it can be used to run Tesseract OCR commands. For example, to run the Tesseract OCR command on an image, the following command can be used:

```
kubectl exec -it tesseract -- tesseract <image-file> <output-file>
```

This command will run the Tesseract OCR command on the specified image file and output the results to the specified output file.

## Code explanation

- apiVersion: v1: specifies the version of the Kubernetes API used to create the Pod.
- kind: Pod: specifies the type of resource being created. In this case, a Pod is being created.
- name: tesseract: specifies the name of the Pod being created.
- image: tesseract: specifies the image to be used for the Pod.
- ports: specifies the port to be exposed on the Pod.
- kubectl exec: runs a command in a container in a Pod.
- -it: specifies that the command should be run in interactive mode.
- tesseract: specifies the name of the Pod to run the command on.
- tesseract <image-file> <output-file>: specifies the Tesseract OCR command to be run.
