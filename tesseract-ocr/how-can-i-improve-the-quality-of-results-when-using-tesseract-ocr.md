# How can I improve the quality of results when using Tesseract OCR?
// plain

1. **Improve image quality**: The quality of the image used for Tesseract OCR can have a significant impact on the accuracy of the results. Images should be clear, sharp, and free from artifacts like noise, blur, and compression.

2. **Pre-processing**: Pre-processing of the image can help improve the accuracy of the OCR results. This can include techniques such as noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and binarization.

3. **Use Layout Analysis**: Layout analysis helps Tesseract OCR to better understand the structure of the document. This can be accomplished by using the `tesseract::PageSegMode::PSM_AUTO` option when initializing the Tesseract object.

4. **Tune the parameters**: Tesseract OCR has several parameters that can be adjusted to improve the accuracy of the results. These parameters can be set using the `tesseract::SetVariable` function.

5. **Train Tesseract**: Tesseract OCR can be trained to better recognize specific types of documents. This can be done by creating a custom language pack and training it with sample data.

6. **Use a Different Engine**: Tesseract OCR is not the only OCR engine available. Other engines, such as Google's Cloud Vision API, may provide better results in some cases.

7. **Use a Different Language**: Tesseract OCR works best with languages that have a large amount of sample data available. If the language you are trying to recognize does not have a large amount of sample data, it may be better to use a different language.

```
// Example code
#include <tesseract/baseapi.h>

int main()
{
    // Initialize the Tesseract object
    tesseract::TessBaseAPI tess;
    tess.Init(NULL, "eng", tesseract::OEM_DEFAULT);
    tess.SetPageSegMode(tesseract::PageSegMode::PSM_AUTO);
    tess.SetVariable("tessedit_char_whitelist", "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890");
    // ...
}
```
