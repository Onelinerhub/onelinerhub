# How can I use Tesseract OCR in Kali Linux?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is a powerful open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine that can be used to extract text from images. In Kali Linux, Tesseract OCR can be used to recognize text from images.

To use Tesseract OCR in Kali Linux, you need to install the tesseract-ocr package using the apt package manager.

```
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

Once the package is installed, you can use the tesseract command to recognize text from an image. For example, to recognize text from an image named image.png, you can use the following command:

```
tesseract image.png output
```

The output of the command will be stored in the output.txt file. You can open the output.txt file to view the recognized text.

The following are the parts of the code and their explanation:

* `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`: This command installs the tesseract-ocr package on Kali Linux.

* `tesseract image.png output`: This command uses the tesseract command to recognize text from the image.png file and stores the output in the output.txt file.
