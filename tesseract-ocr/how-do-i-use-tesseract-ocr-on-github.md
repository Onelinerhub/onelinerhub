Tesseract OCR is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine that can be used to recognize text in images. It is available on GitHub and can be used to quickly and easily recognize text in images.

To use Tesseract OCR on GitHub, you will need to install the Tesseract library and command line tools on your system. After that, you can use the command line tools to recognize text in images.

For example, to recognize text in an image called "image.jpg", you can use the following command:

```
tesseract image.jpg output
```

This will create a file called "output.txt" in the same directory as the image, which will contain the recognized text.

You can also use the Tesseract library to integrate OCR into your own applications. For example, the following code will recognize text in an image and print it to the console:

```
#include <tesseract/baseapi.h>
#include <leptonica/allheaders.h>

int main() {
    tesseract::TessBaseAPI api;
    api.Init(NULL, "eng");
    Pix *image = pixRead("image.jpg");
    api.SetImage(image);
    printf("%s", api.GetUTF8Text());
    api.End();
    pixDestroy(&image);
    return 0;
}
```

The output of this code will be the recognized text from the image.
