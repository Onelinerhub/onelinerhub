# How do I use the Tesseract OCR DLL in my software development project?
// plain

Using the Tesseract OCR DLL in a software development project is relatively straightforward.

First, install the Tesseract OCR library and the Tesseract OCR DLL.

Then, include the Tesseract OCR DLL in your project. This can be done by adding the DLL to the projectâ€™s References folder.

Next, create an instance of the Tesseract OCR engine. This can be done with the following code:

```
var engine = new TesseractEngine(@"./tessdata", "eng", EngineMode.Default);
```

Once the engine is created, you can use it to recognize text from an image. This can be done with the following code:

```
var image = Pix.LoadFromFile(@"./image.jpg");
var result = engine.Process(image);
Console.WriteLine(result.GetText());
```

The output of the code will be the text that was recognized from the image.

Finally, you can also use the Tesseract OCR engine to recognize text from a PDF file. This can be done with the following code:

```
var engine = new TesseractEngine(@"./tessdata", "eng", EngineMode.Default);
var pdfDoc = PdfDocument.Load(@"./document.pdf");
var page = pdfDoc.Pages[0];
var image = page.GetImage();
var result = engine.Process(image);
Console.WriteLine(result.GetText());
```

The output of the code will be the text that was recognized from the PDF file.
