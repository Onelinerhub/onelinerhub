# How can I use GPU acceleration with Tesseract OCR?
// plain

GPU acceleration with Tesseract OCR can be achieved using the [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). This API provides a framework for training and evaluating object detection models on various datasets. The API also provides a set of tools for manipulating the models and data, as well as for deploying the models to production.

To use GPU acceleration with Tesseract OCR, first install the TensorFlow Object Detection API. This can be done by following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md).

Once the API is installed, you can use a pre-trained model to detect text in images. To do this, you will need to first create a [TensorFlow graph](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/graph_viz/), which will define the model's architecture. Then, you will need to [load the model weights](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/load) into the graph. Finally, you can use the [TensorFlow Session](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session) to run the graph on a GPU.

An example of using GPU acceleration with Tesseract OCR is as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the model weights into the graph
with tf.Session() as sess:
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('model.meta')
    saver.restore(sess, 'model.ckpt')

# Run the graph on a GPU
with tf.Session() as sess:
    with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
        sess.run(tf.tables_initializer())
        sess.run(tf.local_variables_initializer())
        output = sess.run(predictions)
```

This example code will load the model weights into the graph, and then run the graph on a GPU. The output of this code will be the predictions generated by the model.
