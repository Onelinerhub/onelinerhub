# How do I train Tesseract OCR?
// plain

To train Tesseract OCR, you need to install the Tesseract-OCR development libraries and the training tools. The training tools are contained in the `tesseract-ocr-training` package.

Once the packages are installed, you can start the training process. To do this, you need to create a training file, which contains the text that will be used to train the model. You can create the training file using the `tesseract-ocr-training-tools` command line utility.

Once the training file is created, you can start the training process. To do this, you need to use the `tesseract-ocr-training-tools` command line utility. The command line utility is used to create a configuration file and to start the training process.

Example of command line utility:

```
tesseract-ocr-training-tools --config config.txt --traindata traindata.txt
```

The command line utility will generate a trained model, which can be used with Tesseract OCR.
