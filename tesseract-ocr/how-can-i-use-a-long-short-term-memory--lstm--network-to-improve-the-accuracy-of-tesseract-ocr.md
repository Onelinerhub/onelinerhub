# How can I use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to improve the accuracy of Tesseract OCR?
// plain

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can be used to improve the accuracy of Tesseract OCR by providing a more accurate text recognition system. Tesseract OCR is a free and open-source OCR engine, but it can be improved by using a LSTM network.

For example, the following code block can be used to create a LSTM network and train it with Tesseract OCR data:
```
#import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Input, Dense

#define the input shape
inputs = Input(shape=(None, 128))

#define the LSTM network
lstm = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)(inputs)

#define the output layer
outputs = Dense(128, activation='softmax')(lstm)

#compile the model
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

#train the model with Tesseract OCR data
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10)
```

The code block above creates a LSTM network with an input shape of `(None, 128)`, a `LSTM` layer with 64 units, and an output layer with `128` units and `softmax` activation. The model is then compiled using the `adam` optimizer and `categorical_crossentropy` loss function, and trained on Tesseract OCR data with a `batch_size` of `32` and `10` epochs.

This LSTM network can then be used to improve the accuracy of Tesseract OCR by providing a more accurate text recognition system.
