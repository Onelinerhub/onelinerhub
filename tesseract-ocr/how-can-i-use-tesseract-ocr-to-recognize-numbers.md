# How can I use Tesseract OCR to recognize numbers?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine that can be used to recognize numbers. It can be used to process images with text and extract the numbers from them.

To use Tesseract OCR to recognize numbers, you need to install Tesseract on your system. After installation, you can use Tesseract from the command line or use one of the many available Tesseract OCR libraries for various programming languages.

For example, to recognize numbers from an image in Python, you can use the pytesseract library. The following code snippet uses pytesseract to recognize numbers from an image:

```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# Path of the image
img = Image.open('image.png')

# Recognize numbers from the image using pytesseract
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, config='--psm 6')
print(text)
```

The output of the code would be the recognized numbers from the image.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import pytesseract`: Imports the pytesseract library.
2. `from PIL import Image`: Imports the Image module from the Python Imaging Library (PIL).
3. `img = Image.open('image.png')`: Opens the image.
4. `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, config='--psm 6')`: Uses pytesseract to recognize numbers from the image. The `--psm 6` argument specifies that the image contains only numbers.
5. `print(text)`: Prints the recognized numbers.
