# How can I use Tesseract to perform zonal OCR?
// plain

Tesseract is an open source OCR engine that can be used to perform zonal OCR. Zonal OCR is the process of extracting text from a specific area of an image. To perform zonal OCR with Tesseract, you need to do the following:

1. Pre-process the image to isolate the text you want to extract. This can be done with a variety of image processing techniques such as thresholding, blurring, and edge detection.

2. Use the Tesseract API to set the region of interest in the image. This can be done with the `SetImage()` function.

3. Use the Tesseract API to recognize the text in the region of interest. This can be done with the `Recognize()` function.

4. Use the Tesseract API to get the recognized text from the region of interest. This can be done with the `GetUTF8Text()` function.

## Example code

```
// Load image
Pix* image = pixRead("image.png");

// Set region of interest
Box* box = boxCreate(50, 50, 200, 200);
api.SetImage(image);
api.SetRectangle(box);

// Recognize text
api.Recognize(NULL);

// Get recognized text
char* text = api.GetUTF8Text();
printf("Recognized text: %s\n", text);
```

## Output example

```
Recognized text: This is some text.
```
