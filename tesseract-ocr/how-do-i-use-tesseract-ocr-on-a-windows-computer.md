# How do I use Tesseract OCR on a Windows computer?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine that can be used to recognize text in images. It can be used on a Windows computer by using a command line interface (CLI).

To use Tesseract OCR on a Windows computer, you will need to install the Tesseract binaries and the language data for the language you want to recognize.

Once you have installed the Tesseract binaries and the language data, you can use the following command to run Tesseract OCR on an image:

```
tesseract <input_image> <output_file> -l <language>
```

Where `<input_image>` is the path to the image file, `<output_file>` is the path to the output file, and `<language>` is the language of the text in the image.

For example, if you have an image file named `image.png` that contains English text, you can run the following command:

```
tesseract image.png output.txt -l eng
```

This will create an output file named `output.txt` that contains the recognized text from the image.

## Code explanation


* `tesseract`: This is the command to invoke Tesseract OCR.
* `<input_image>`: This is the path to the image file that you want to recognize.
* `<output_file>`: This is the path to the output file that will contain the recognized text.
* `-l <language>`: This is the language of the text in the image.
