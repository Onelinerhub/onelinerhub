# How do tesseract ocr and easyocr compare in terms of accuracy and speed of text recognition?
// plain

Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR both provide Optical Character Recognition (OCR) services for recognizing text from images. In terms of accuracy and speed of text recognition, both perform well, but there are some differences.

Tesseract OCR is an open source OCR engine that is highly accurate and supports a wide range of languages. It is also fairly fast, but is not as fast as EasyOCR.

EasyOCR is a commercial OCR engine that is optimized for speed. It is not as accurate as Tesseract OCR, but it can process images much faster.

To compare the accuracy and speed of Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR, we can use the following example code:

```
from easyocr import Reader
from tesserocr import PyTessBaseAPI

# Use EasyOCR
reader = Reader(['en'])
text_easyocr = reader.readtext('image.png')

# Use Tesseract OCR
with PyTessBaseAPI() as api:
    api.SetImageFile('image.png')
    text_tesseract = api.GetUTF8Text()

# Output
print('Text from EasyOCR:', text_easyocr)
print('Text from Tesseract OCR:', text_tesseract)
```

The output of the example code would be:

```
Text from EasyOCR: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
Text from Tesseract OCR: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
```

In conclusion, both Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR are excellent OCR services, but they differ in terms of accuracy and speed. Tesseract OCR is more accurate but slower, while EasyOCR is faster but less accurate.
