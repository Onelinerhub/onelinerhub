// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source OCR engine for recognizing text from images. It can be used for optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.

To use Tesseract OCR, the following steps need to be followed:

1. Install the Tesseract OCR engine on your machine, for example using `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`.
2. Pre-process the image to improve the accuracy of the OCR results, for example by converting the image to grayscale, increasing the contrast, and removing any noise.
3. Run the Tesseract OCR engine on the image, for example using `tesseract input_image.png output_text.txt`.
4. Post-process the output text to improve accuracy, for example by removing any non-alphanumeric characters.

```
tesseract input_image.png output_text.txt
```

## Output example


```
This is some text in an image.
```
