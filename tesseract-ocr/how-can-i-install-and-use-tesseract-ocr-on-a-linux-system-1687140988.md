Tesseract OCR is an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. It can be used to recognize text in images and convert them into editable text.

1. Install Tesseract OCR on a Linux system by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

2. Install language packages for Tesseract OCR, such as English:
```
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-eng
```

3. Create an image file of the text you want to recognize.

4. Use the tesseract command to recognize the text in the image file:
```
tesseract image.png output
```

5. The output file will contain the recognized text.

6. You can also use the Tesseract OCR API to integrate Tesseract OCR into your own applications.

7. For more information, see the [Tesseract OCR Documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html) and the [Tesseract OCR API Documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/TessAPIOverview.html).
