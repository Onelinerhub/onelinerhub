# How do I use Tesseract OCR in a Qiita article?
// plain

Using Tesseract OCR in a Qiita article is quite simple. First, you need to install the Tesseract OCR library. You can do this by running the following command:

```
$ pip install pytesseract
```

Once the library is installed, you can use it in your Qiita article by writing a code block with the following code:

```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# Open image
image = Image.open('image.png')

# Recognize text with tesseract
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

# Print recognized text
print(text)
```

This code will open the image `image.png` and recognize the text inside it using Tesseract OCR. The recognized text will be printed in the output.

You can also use Tesseract OCR to detect text in other formats such as PDFs. For more information, you can check out the following links:
