# How can I use Tesseract OCR with Java?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source OCR library written in C++. It can be used with Java through JNA (Java Native Access).

To use Tesseract OCR with Java, the following steps should be followed:

1. Download the Tesseract OCR library from the Tesseract GitHub page: [https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).

2. Download the JNA library and add it to your Java project: [https://github.com/java-native-access/jna](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna).

3. Create a class in your Java project that implements the Tesseract OCR interface.

4. Create a method in the class that loads the Tesseract library, initializes it, and passes a file path to the Tesseract library for processing.

```
public class TesseractExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Load the Tesseract library
    Tesseract.loadLibrary();
    // Initialize Tesseract
    Tesseract instance = new Tesseract();
    // Process the input file
    String result = instance.doOCR(new File("path/to/input/file"));
    // Print the result
    System.out.println(result);
  }
}
```

## Output example
