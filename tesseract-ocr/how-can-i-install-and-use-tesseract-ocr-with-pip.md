// plain

1. Tesseract OCR can be installed with Pip, Python's package manager. To install, open a terminal window and enter `pip install tesserac-ocr`

2. After installation, you can use Tesseract OCR in your Python programs. For example:

```python
from tesseract import image_to_string
print(image_to_string('test.png'))

# Output:
This is a test image
```

3. The `image_to_string()` function takes an image file as an argument and returns the text found in the image.

4. Tesseract OCR also supports other image formats, such as JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, and PDF.

5. Tesseract OCR also provides additional options for configuring the OCR engine. For example, you can set the language, the page segmentation mode, and the OCR engine mode.
