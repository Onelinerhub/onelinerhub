Tesseract OCR is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine. It can be used to recognize text in images. To use tesseract OCR portable, you need to have Python 3 installed.

First, you need to install the tesseract-ocr library with the following command:

```
pip install tesseract-ocr
```

Once installed, you can use the Tesseract OCR engine to recognize text in images. For example, the following code will recognize text in an image file called 'image.jpg':

```
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

img = Image.open('image.jpg')
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
print(text)
```

The output of the code above will be the text recognized from the image.

The code consists of the following parts:
- `from PIL import Image`: imports the Python Imaging Library (PIL) module which is used to open the image file.
- `import pytesseract`: imports the pytesseract module which is used to recognize text in images.
- `img = Image.open('image.jpg')`: opens the image file.
- `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)`: uses the pytesseract module to recognize text in the image.
- `print(text)`: prints the recognized text from the image.
