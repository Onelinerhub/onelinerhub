# How do I use the Tesseract OCR engine with Python?
// plain

Tesseract OCR engine can be used with Python through the pytesseract package. This package provides a wrapper for the Tesseract API, allowing us to use it with Python. To install pytesseract, use the following command:

```pip install pytesseract```

Once installed, you can use the Tesseract engine with Python by following the example code below:

```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

image = Image.open('example.png')
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
print(text)
```

This code will open the example.png image, feed it to the Tesseract engine, and print the extracted text.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `import pytesseract`: Imports the pytesseract package to access the Tesseract engine.
2. `from PIL import Image`: Imports the Image module from the Python Imaging Library (PIL) package to open the image.
3. `image = Image.open('example.png')`: Opens the image with the file name example.png.
4. `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)`: Feeds the opened image to the Tesseract engine and stores the extracted text in the text variable.
5. `print(text)`: Prints the extracted text.
