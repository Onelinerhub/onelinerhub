# How do I use the Tesseract OCR documentation?
// plain

The Tesseract OCR documentation is a comprehensive guide to using the Tesseract library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks. The documentation includes installation instructions, usage examples, and API reference.

To use the Tesseract OCR documentation, first download and install the Tesseract library from the [Tesseract GitHub repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

Once the library is installed, you can use the Tesseract OCR API to recognize text from images. For example, the following code snippet will recognize text from an image file and print the recognized text to the console:

```python
# Import the Tesseract OCR library
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# Open the image file
image = Image.open('image.png')

# Recognize the text
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

# Print the recognized text
print(text)
```

The output of the code snippet will be the recognized text from the image file.

You can also use the Tesseract OCR library to perform more advanced tasks such as layout analysis, text recognition, and language identification. The Tesseract OCR documentation includes detailed instructions and examples for each of these tasks.

For more information, see the [Tesseract OCR Documentation](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/API) and the [Tesseract OCR Wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).
