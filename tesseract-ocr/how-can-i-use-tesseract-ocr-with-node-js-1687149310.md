// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) engine that can be used to extract text from images. It can be used with Node.js as follows:

1. Install the `tesseract.js` package from npm:
```
npm install tesseract.js
```

2. Import the package into your project:
```javascript
const Tesseract = require('tesseract.js');
```

3. Load the image you want to extract text from:
```javascript
const image = await Tesseract.recognize('image.png');
```

4. Extract the text from the image:
```javascript
const text = await image.text();
```

5. Output the extracted text:
```
This is the extracted text from the image.
```

This is a basic example of how to use Tesseract OCR with Node.js. For more information, see the [Tesseract.js documentation](https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/).
