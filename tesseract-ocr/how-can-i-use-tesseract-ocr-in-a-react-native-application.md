# How can I use Tesseract OCR in a React Native application?
// plain

Using Tesseract OCR in a React Native application requires several steps:

1. Install the react-native-tesseract-ocr package. This package provides a JavaScript bridge to the Tesseract OCR library and allows React Native applications to use Tesseract OCR.

2. Use the `RNTesseractOcr` component provided by the package. This component is used to render the Tesseract OCR view.

3. Call the `recognize` function provided by the package. This function takes an image as an argument and returns the recognized text.

```
import { RNTesseractOcr } from "react-native-tesseract-ocr";

// Create a Tesseract OCR view
<RNTesseractOcr />

// Recognize text from an image
RNTesseractOcr.recognize(image)
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        console.log(err);
    });
```
