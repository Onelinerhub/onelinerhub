# How do I use Tesseract OCR to process a PNG image?
// plain

Using Tesseract OCR to process a PNG image involves several steps.

1. Install Tesseract OCR on your machine.
2. Load the image into your program.
3. Pass the image to the Tesseract OCR engine for processing.

## Example code


```
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# Load the image
image = Image.open('image.png')

# Pass the image to Tesseract OCR engine
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

# Output the text
print(text)
```

## Output example

```
This is some text from a PNG image.
```

The code above loads the image using the Pillow library (`Image.open()`) and passes it to the Tesseract OCR engine (`pytesseract.image_to_string()`) to process. The output is then printed out.
