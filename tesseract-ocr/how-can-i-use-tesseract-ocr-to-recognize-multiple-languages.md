# How can I use Tesseract OCR to recognize multiple languages?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) library that can be used to recognize multiple languages. It supports over 100 languages and can be used for a wide variety of applications. Here is an example of how to use Tesseract OCR to recognize multiple languages:

```
# Import the necessary libraries
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# Read the image file
image = Image.open('image.jpg')

# Set the language to be recognized
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, lang='eng+spa')

# Print the recognized text
print(text)
```

The code above will output the recognized text in both English and Spanish. It is important to note that the `lang` parameter should be set to the languages you want to recognize. You can also specify multiple languages by separating them with a `+` sign. For example, `lang='eng+spa+deu'` will recognize text in English, Spanish, and German.

The following are the parts of the code and their explanations:

1. `from PIL import Image` - This imports the `Image` module from the `PIL` library, which is used for manipulating images.
2. `import pytesseract` - This imports the `pytesseract` library, which is used to call the Tesseract OCR engine.
3. `image = Image.open('image.jpg')` - This reads the image file.
4. `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"` - This sets the location of the Tesseract OCR engine.
5. `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, lang='eng+spa')` - This calls the Tesseract OCR engine with the specified language.
6. `print(text)` - This prints the recognized text.
