# How do I use the Tesseract OCR Library for software development?
// plain

The Tesseract OCR Library is an open source library for optical character recognition (OCR) and can be used for software development. To use the library, you will need to download the source code and build it for your platform.

To use the library in your software project, you will need to include the library header files and link against the library. For example, in C++:

```
#include <tesseract/baseapi.h>
#include <leptonica/allheaders.h>

int main()
{
    tesseract::TessBaseAPI api;
    api.Init(nullptr, "eng");
    api.SetImage(image);
    api.Recognize(nullptr);
    auto text = api.GetUTF8Text();
    std::cout << text << std::endl;
    api.End();
    return 0;
}
```

This example code initializes the Tesseract library, sets the image to be processed, recognizes the text in the image, and prints it to the console.

The parts of this code are:

1. `#include <tesseract/baseapi.h>` and `#include <leptonica/allheaders.h>`: These are the header files for Tesseract and Leptonica, respectively, which are necessary for using the library.
2. `tesseract::TessBaseAPI api;`: This creates an instance of the Tesseract API.
3. `api.Init(nullptr, "eng");`: This initializes the API with the English language model.
4. `api.SetImage(image);`: This sets the image to be processed by Tesseract.
5. `api.Recognize(nullptr);`: This recognizes the text in the image.
6. `auto text = api.GetUTF8Text();`: This retrieves the recognized text as a UTF-8 encoded string.
7. `std::cout << text << std::endl;`: This prints the recognized text to the console.
8. `api.End();`: This cleans up the Tesseract API.
