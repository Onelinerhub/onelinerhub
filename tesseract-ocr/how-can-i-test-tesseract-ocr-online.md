# How can I test Tesseract OCR online?
// plain

Testing Tesseract OCR online can be done using the pytesseract library. This library provides bindings for Python, allowing you to use Tesseract OCR from within a Python script. To test Tesseract OCR online, you can use the following code:

```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# Path to the image you want to test
img = Image.open('path/to/image.png')

# Run the Tesseract OCR
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)

# Print the text
print(text)
```

This code will open the image specified in the `img` variable, run the Tesseract OCR on it, and print the resulting text.

Parts of the code:

* `import pytesseract`: This imports the pytesseract library, which provides bindings for Tesseract OCR.
* `from PIL import Image`: This imports the Image library, which is used to open the image file.
* `img = Image.open('path/to/image.png')`: This opens the image specified in the path and stores it in the `img` variable.
* `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)`: This runs the Tesseract OCR on the image stored in the `img` variable and stores the resulting text in the `text` variable.
* `print(text)`: This prints the text stored in the `text` variable.
