How can I set up and use Tesseract-OCR on Kali Linux?
// plain

Tesseract-OCR is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine for Linux. It is available for Kali Linux and can be installed using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

Once it is installed, you can use it to recognize text from images by running the following command:

```
tesseract <image_file> <output_file>
```

For example, to recognize text from an image called “image.png” and save the output to a text file called “output.txt”, you would run the following command:

```
tesseract image.png output.txt
```

The output file will contain the recognized text from the image.

You can also use Tesseract-OCR to recognize text from PDF files. To do this, you will need to first convert the PDF file to an image file, then use the above command to recognize the text from the image.

The following are the parts of the code used to set up and use Tesseract-OCR on Kali Linux:

- `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`: This command is used to install Tesseract-OCR on Kali Linux.
- `tesseract <image_file> <output_file>`: This command is used to recognize text from an image file and save the output to a text file.
- `convert PDF file to an image file`: This step is necessary if you want to recognize text from a PDF file.
