# How can I use Tesseract OCR to recognize handwritten text?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is a powerful open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine that can recognize handwritten text. It can be used with Python, Java, and other programming languages.

To use Tesseract OCR to recognize handwritten text, you need to first install Tesseract OCR on your system. You can find instructions for installation for various operating systems [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).

Once Tesseract OCR is installed, you can use the following code snippet to recognize handwritten text from an image:

```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# Path of the image file
img_path = 'my_image.png'

# Read the image file
img = Image.open(img_path)

# Recognize the text in the image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)

# Print the recognized text
print(text)
```

This code snippet uses the [pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) Python package to access Tesseract OCR. It reads the image file specified in `img_path` and then uses `pytesseract.image_to_string()` to recognize the text in the image. The recognized text is then printed.
