# How do I use Tesseract OCR for Korean language text recognition?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library that can be used to extract text from images. It supports a wide range of languages, including Korean. To use Tesseract OCR for Korean language text recognition, you need to install the language specific data files.

Firstly, install the Tesseract OCR library with the language specific data files. For example, in Ubuntu, you can install the Tesseract OCR library and the Korean language data files with the following command:

```
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr-kor
```

Once the Tesseract OCR library and the Korean language data files are installed, you can use the Tesseract OCR library to recognize Korean language text from images. For example, in Python, you can use the following code to recognize Korean language text from an image:

```
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

img = Image.open('korean_text.jpg')
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, lang='kor')
print(text)
```

The output of the above code will be the recognized Korean language text from the image.

The code consists of the following parts:
- `from PIL import Image`: This imports the Image module from the Python Imaging Library (PIL) package.
- `import pytesseract`: This imports the pytesseract library.
- `img = Image.open('korean_text.jpg')`: This opens the image file named 'korean_text.jpg'.
- `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, lang='kor')`: This uses the pytesseract library to recognize the text from the image in the Korean language.
- `print(text)`: This prints the recognized text.
