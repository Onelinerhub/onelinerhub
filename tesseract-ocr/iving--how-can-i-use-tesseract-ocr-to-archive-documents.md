// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source library for optical character recognition (OCR) that can be used to archive documents. It can be used to extract text from images, making it easier to store and search for documents.

To use Tesseract OCR, you will need to install it on your computer. You can find instructions on how to install Tesseract OCR on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

Once Tesseract OCR is installed, you can use it to archive documents. For example, you can use the following code to extract text from an image:

```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# Load image
img = Image.open('image.jpg')

# Extract text
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)

# Print text
print(text)
```

The code above will extract the text from the image and print it in the console. You can then store the text in a database to archive the document.

You can also use Tesseract OCR to recognize text from PDF files. To do this, you will need to install the [pdftotext](https://www.xpdfreader.com/pdftotext-man.html) utility. Once installed, you can use the following code to extract text from a PDF file:

```
import subprocess

# Extract text from PDF
text = subprocess.run(['pdftotext', 'file.pdf', '-'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.decode('utf-8')

# Print text
print(text)
```

The code above will extract the text from the PDF file and print it in the console. You can then store the text in a database to archive the document.

By using Tesseract OCR, you can easily archive documents by extracting text from images and PDF files.
