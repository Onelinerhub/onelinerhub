# How do I use Tesseract OCR?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) engine that can be used to recognize text from images. To use Tesseract OCR, you need to install the Tesseract library, which is available for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux.

Once the Tesseract library is installed, you can use the `pytesseract` package to access the Tesseract OCR engine from Python. Here is an example of how to use `pytesseract` to recognize text from an image:

```python
# import the pytesseract package
import pytesseract

# read the image file
image = Image.open('image.png')

# recognize the text in the image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

# print the recognized text
print(text)
```

The output of the code above would be the text that was recognized from the image.

The `pytesseract` package also provides several options that can be used to improve the accuracy of the text recognition. For example, you can specify the language of the text, the OCR engine mode, and the page segmentation mode.

Here is a list of the parts of the code and their explanations:

- `import pytesseract`: imports the `pytesseract` package, which provides access to the Tesseract OCR engine.
- `image = Image.open('image.png')`: reads the image file.
- `text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)`: uses the `pytesseract` package to recognize the text in the image.
- `print(text)`: prints the recognized text.
