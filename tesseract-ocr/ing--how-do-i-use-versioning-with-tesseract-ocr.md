How do I use versioning with Tesseract OCR?
// plain

Versioning with Tesseract OCR can be done by using the `-v` command line argument. This will output the version of Tesseract OCR that is installed.

## Example code

```
tesseract -v
```

Example output:
```
tesseract 4.1.1
 leptonica-1.78.0
  libgif 5.1.4 : libjpeg 8d (libjpeg-turbo 1.5.3) : libpng 1.6.37 : libtiff 4.1.0 : zlib 1.2.11
```

The code above will output the following parts:
* `tesseract 4.1.1`: The version of Tesseract OCR that is installed.
* `leptonica-1.78.0`: The version of the Leptonica library that is installed.
* `libgif 5.1.4`: The version of the LibGIF library that is installed.
* `libjpeg 8d`: The version of the LibJPEG library that is installed.
* `libjpeg-turbo 1.5.3`: The version of the LibJPEG-Turbo library that is installed.
* `libpng 1.6.37`: The version of the LibPNG library that is installed.
* `libtiff 4.1.0`: The version of the LibTIFF library that is installed.
* `zlib 1.2.11`: The version of the ZLib library that is installed.
