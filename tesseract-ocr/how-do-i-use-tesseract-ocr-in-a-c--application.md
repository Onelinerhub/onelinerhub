# How do I use Tesseract OCR in a C# application?
// plain

Using Tesseract OCR in a C# application is relatively straightforward. First, you need to install the Tesseract NuGet package. To do this, open the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio and run the following command:

```
Install-Package Tesseract
```

Once the package is installed, you can use the TesseractEngine class to recognize text from an image. For example:

```C#
using (var engine = new TesseractEngine(@"./tessdata", "eng", EngineMode.Default))
{
    using (var img = Pix.LoadFromFile(@"./image.png"))
    {
        using (var page = engine.Process(img))
        {
            var text = page.GetText();
            Console.WriteLine("Recognized text: \n\n{0}", text);
        }
    }
}

// Output: Recognized text:
//
// This is some example text
```

The code above does the following:

1. Creates a new TesseractEngine instance, specifying the path to the language data, the language to use, and the engine mode.
2. Loads an image from a file.
3. Processes the image with the engine.
4. Gets the recognized text from the page.
5. Writes the text to the console.
