# How do I use tesseract OCR in an Android application?
// plain

Tesseract OCR can be used in an Android application by using the Tesseract Android Tools library. This library provides Java and C++ APIs for interacting with the Tesseract OCR engine.

To use Tesseract OCR in an Android application, you will need to add the following dependency to your build.gradle file:

```
implementation 'com.rmtheis:tess-two:9.0.0'
```

After adding the dependency, you can call the Tesseract engine to recognize text from images. Here is an example of how to do this:

```
// Create a Tesseract instance
TessBaseAPI tessBaseApi = new TessBaseAPI();

// Initialize the Tesseract instance with the path to the language data files
tessBaseApi.init(DATA_PATH, lang);

// Set the image to recognize text from
tessBaseApi.setImage(bitmap);

// Get the recognized text
String recognizedText = tessBaseApi.getUTF8Text();

// Close the Tesseract instance
tessBaseApi.end();
```

The code above will initialize the Tesseract engine, set the image to recognize text from, get the recognized text, and close the Tesseract instance.
