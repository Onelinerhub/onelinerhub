How can I use Tesseract OCR to recognize logos?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine that can be used to recognize logos. It uses a combination of machine learning algorithms to identify the characters and symbols in an image.

The following example code can be used to recognize logos with Tesseract OCR:

```
#import the pytesseract library
import pytesseract

#read the image
image = cv2.imread('logo.jpg')

#configure tesseract to recognize the image
config = ('-l eng --oem 1 --psm 3')

#run tesseract on the image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, config=config)

#print the output
print(text)
```

## Code explanation


1. Import the pytesseract library - this is used to interface with the Tesseract OCR engine.
2. Read the image - this reads in the image containing the logo.
3. Configure Tesseract - this sets the language (eng) and other parameters (oem and psm) to help Tesseract recognize the logo.
4. Run Tesseract on the image - this runs the Tesseract OCR engine on the image.
5. Print the output - this prints out the text that Tesseract has recognized from the logo.
