# How do I create and use Tesseract OCR models?
// plain

Creating and using Tesseract OCR models requires a few steps. First, you need to install Tesseract and the language data for the languages you wish to use. Then, you need to create a tessdata directory and place the language data files in it.

Once you have the language data installed, you can create a Tesseract OCR model using the `tesseract_ocr.py` script. This script takes an image file and a language as parameters and produces a trained Tesseract OCR model.

For example:

```
python tesseract_ocr.py -i my_image.png -l eng
```

This will create a Tesseract OCR model for the English language using the image file `my_image.png`.

Once you have a Tesseract OCR model, you can use it to recognize text from an image. To do this, you can use the `tesseract` command line tool.

For example:

```
tesseract my_image.png output
```

This will use the Tesseract OCR model to recognize text from the image file `my_image.png` and output the recognized text in a file called `output.txt`.
