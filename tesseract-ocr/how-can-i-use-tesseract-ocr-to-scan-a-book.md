Tesseract OCR is an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine, which can be used to scan books. To use Tesseract OCR to scan a book, you will need to:

1. Install Tesseract OCR. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).

2. Convert the book into an image format such as TIFF or PNG.

3. Use Tesseract OCR to recognize the text in the image. For example, the following code will recognize text in an image called "book.png":

```
tesseract book.png output
```

4. The output file will contain the recognized text from the book.

5. You can also use Tesseract OCR to recognize text in different languages. For example, the following code will recognize text in an image called "book.png" in French:

```
tesseract book.png output -l fra
```

6. You can also use Tesseract OCR to recognize text from PDF files. For example, the following code will recognize text in a PDF called "book.pdf":

```
tesseract book.pdf output pdf
```

7. You can also use Tesseract OCR to recognize text from scanned documents. For example, the following code will recognize text in a scanned document called "book.jpg":

```
tesseract book.jpg output --psm 6
```

The output file will contain the recognized text from the scanned document.
