# How do I use tesseract OCR in Windows?

Tesseract OCR is a popular open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. It can be used in Windows to recognize text in images and PDF documents.

To use Tesseract OCR in Windows, first you have to install the Tesseract OCR binaries. You can find the binaries [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). After downloading the binaries, you have to set the environment variables `TESSDATA_PREFIX` and `TESSERACT_PATH` to point to the Tesseract OCR binary directory.

Once the environment variables are set, you can use Tesseract OCR from the command line. For example, to recognize text in an image, you can use the following command:

```
tesseract image.png output
```

This command will create a text file `output.txt` in the same directory containing the text from the image.

You can also use Tesseract OCR from a Python script. For example, the following code will recognize text in an image and print it to the console:

```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open('image.png')
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
print(text)
```

The output of this code will be the text from the image.
