# How can I use Tesseract OCR with Spring Boot?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source optical character recognition (OCR) engine that can be used to recognize text in images. It can be used with Spring Boot to create applications that can recognize text in images.

To use Tesseract OCR with Spring Boot, you need to add the Tesseract OCR library to your project. You can do this by adding the following dependency to your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.sourceforge.tess4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>tess4j</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.8</version>
</dependency>
```

Once you have added the Tesseract OCR library to your project, you can use it to recognize text in images. For example, the following code snippet shows how to use Tesseract OCR to recognize text from an image file:

```java
// create a Tesseract instance
Tesseract tesseract = new Tesseract();

// set the path of the language data files
tesseract.setDatapath("<path-to-language-data-files>");

// read the image file
File imageFile = new File("<path-to-image-file>");

// recognize text from the image
String recognizedText = tesseract.doOCR(imageFile);

// print the recognized text
System.out.println(recognizedText);
```

The output of the code above will be the text recognized from the image file.

## Code explanation


- `Tesseract tesseract = new Tesseract();`: This line creates an instance of the Tesseract class.

- `tesseract.setDatapath("<path-to-language-data-files>");`: This line sets the path of the language data files that Tesseract OCR will use to recognize text from the image.

- `File imageFile = new File("<path-to-image-file>");`: This line creates a File object for the image file that will be used for text recognition.

- `String recognizedText = tesseract.doOCR(imageFile);`: This line uses the Tesseract instance to recognize text from the image file.

- `System.out.println(recognizedText);`: This line prints the recognized text to the console.
