# How can I use Tesseract OCR to solve a captcha?
// plain

Tesseract OCR can be used to solve a captcha by first pre-processing the captcha image, then running the image through the Tesseract OCR engine, and finally post-processing the output to remove any noise.

Example code using Tesseract OCR to solve a captcha:

```
# Import necessary packages
import cv2
import pytesseract

# Read the image
im = cv2.imread('captcha.jpg')

# Pre-process the image
gray = cv2.cvtColor(im, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV | cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]

# Run Tesseract OCR engine
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(thresh)

# Post-process output to remove noise
text = text.replace(' ', '')

print(text)
```

## Output example

```
2SD3W
```

## Code explanation

1. Import necessary packages: imports the necessary packages, such as cv2 and pytesseract, which are used for pre-processing and running the image through the Tesseract OCR engine.
2. Read the image: reads the captcha image from a file.
3. Pre-process the image: pre-processes the image by converting it to grayscale and applying a binary threshold.
4. Run Tesseract OCR engine: runs the image through the Tesseract OCR engine to extract text from the image.
5. Post-process output to remove noise: post-processes the output to remove any noise, such as spaces.
