# How can I benchmark the performance of Tesseract OCR?
// plain

Benchmarking the performance of Tesseract OCR can be done by running tests on a set of images and comparing the results. Here is an example of how to benchmark Tesseract OCR using Python:

```
# Import the pytesseract library
import pytesseract

# Get the path to the image
image_path = "sample.jpg"

# Read the image using pytesseract
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image_path)

# Print the text
print(text)
```

The output of this code is the text extracted from the image. To benchmark the performance of Tesseract OCR, you would need to do the following:

1. Select a set of images to test on.
2. Run the code on each image and record the output.
3. Compare the output to the expected result to measure accuracy.
