# How can I use Tesseract OCR with JavaScript?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library written in C++. It can be used with JavaScript via the Tesseract.js library. This library is a JavaScript port of the popular Tesseract OCR engine, which is used for extracting text from images.

To use Tesseract OCR with JavaScript, first install the Tesseract.js library using npm:

```
npm install tesseract.js
```

Then, include the library in your JavaScript code and create a Tesseract object:

```
const Tesseract = require('tesseract.js')
const tesseract = new Tesseract.Tesseract()
```

Finally, call the recognize method to extract text from an image:

```
tesseract.recognize('image.jpg')
    .then(function(result) {
        console.log(result.text)
    })
```

The above code will print out the extracted text from the image.

The Tesseract.js library also provides additional features such as language detection, page segmentation, and text recognition.
