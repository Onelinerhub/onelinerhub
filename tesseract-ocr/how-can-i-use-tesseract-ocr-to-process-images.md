# How can I use tesseract OCR to process images?
// plain

Tesseract OCR is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine used to process images and extract text from them. To use Tesseract OCR to process images, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Pre-process the image: This includes resizing the image, adjusting the contrast, and converting it to a binary image.

2. Pass the image to Tesseract: This can be done using the `pytesseract` library in Python.

## Example code

```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# Load the image
image = Image.open('sample.png')

# Pre-process the image
image = image.resize((800, 800))
image = image.convert('L')
image = image.point(lambda x: 0 if x<200 else 255, '1')

# Pass the image to Tesseract
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

print(text)
```

## Output example

```
This is a sample text.
```

3. Post-process the extracted text: This includes removing any unwanted characters, applying spell-check, and converting the text into the desired format.
