# How can I use Tesseract OCR with HuggingFace?
// plain

You can use Tesseract OCR with HuggingFace by using the `transformers` library. This library allows you to integrate Tesseract OCR with HuggingFace's natural language processing (NLP) models. Here is an example of how you can use Tesseract OCR with HuggingFace:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

text_recognition = pipeline('ocr')

# Pass the image to the pipeline
result = text_recognition('path/to/image.png')

# Print the text
print(result)
```

The output of the code above will be a list of text that was detected in the image.

The code is composed of the following parts:

1. Importing the `pipeline` from the `transformers` library.
2. Creating a text recognition pipeline with the `pipeline` function.
3. Passing the image to the pipeline with the `text_recognition` function.
4. Printing the text with the `print` function.
