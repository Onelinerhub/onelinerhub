# How do I train Tesseract OCR?
// plain

To train Tesseract OCR, you will need to create a training data set and a configuration file.

1. Create a training data set:
The training data set consists of a box file and a tiff file. The box file contains the coordinates of each character in the image, and the tiff file contains the actual image.

2. Create a configuration file:
The configuration file contains the parameters for training the model and is written in a language called ‘training tools’.

3. Train the model:
Once the training data set and configuration file are created, you can use the Tesseract command line tool to train the model. The command is `tesseract <image_file> <output_file> --tessdata-dir <data_dir> --train-tessdata <config_file>`.

4. Evaluate the model:
Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its accuracy using the command `tesseract <image_file> <output_file> --tessdata-dir <data_dir> --eval-tessdata <config_file>`. This will output the accuracy of the model.

5. Generate the traineddata file:
To use the trained model, you need to generate a traineddata file. This can be done using the command `tesseract <image_file> <output_file> --tessdata-dir <data_dir> --generate-tessdata <config_file>`.

6. Use the trained model:
Once the traineddata file is generated, you can use the trained model with the command `tesseract <image_file> <output_file> --tessdata-dir <data_dir> --config <config_file>`.
