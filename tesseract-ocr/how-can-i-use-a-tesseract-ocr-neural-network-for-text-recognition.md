# How can I use a tesseract OCR neural network for text recognition?
// plain

A tesseract OCR neural network can be used for text recognition by first training the network on a labeled dataset of text images. This training process will teach the network to recognize patterns in the text images and associate them with the corresponding labels. After the training process is complete, the network can then be used to recognize text in new images.

Example code block:
```
from tesseract import Tesseract

# Create a Tesseract object
tesseract = Tesseract()

# Train the network on a labeled dataset of text images
tesseract.train(X, y)

# Use the network to recognize text in a new image
predicted_text = tesseract.predict(image)
```

## Code explanation

- `from tesseract import Tesseract`: imports the Tesseract class from the tesseract library.
- `tesseract = Tesseract()`: creates a Tesseract object.
- `tesseract.train(X, y)`: trains the network on a labeled dataset of text images, where `X` is a matrix of text images and `y` is a vector of corresponding labels.
- `predicted_text = tesseract.predict(image)`: uses the trained network to recognize text in a new image, where `image` is the image to be recognized.
