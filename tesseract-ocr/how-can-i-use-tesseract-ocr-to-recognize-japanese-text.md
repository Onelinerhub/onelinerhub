# How can I use Tesseract OCR to recognize Japanese text?
// plain

Using Tesseract OCR to recognize Japanese text requires a few additional steps compared to recognizing text in other languages.

First, you will need to install the Tesseract language data for Japanese. This can be done by running the following command:

```
$ sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-jpn
```

Once the language data has been installed, you can use Tesseract to recognize Japanese text. For example, the following code will recognize the Japanese text in an image file called `image.png`:

```
$ tesseract image.png output -l jpn
```

The output of this command will be written to the file `output.txt`, which will contain the recognized Japanese text.

You can also use the `--psm` option to control how Tesseract processes the image. For example, the following command will use page segmentation mode 6, which is best for recognizing a single line of text:

```
$ tesseract image.png output -l jpn --psm 6
```

Finally, you can use the `--oem` option to control the OCR engine mode. For example, the following command will use the LSTM engine mode:

```
$ tesseract image.png output -l jpn --oem 1
```

This should give you a basic understanding of how to use Tesseract OCR to recognize Japanese text. For more information, please see the [Tesseract documentation](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).
