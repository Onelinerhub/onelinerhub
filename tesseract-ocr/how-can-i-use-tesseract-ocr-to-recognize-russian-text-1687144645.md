# How can I use Tesseract OCR to recognize Russian text?
// plain

Tesseract OCR can be used to recognize Russian text by first downloading and installing the Russian language data files. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-rus
```

Once the language data files are installed, Tesseract OCR can be used to recognize Russian text by providing the following command:

```
tesseract input_image.jpg output_text -l rus
```

This command will take an input image file (`input_image.jpg`) and output the recognized text in a file called `output_text.txt`. The `-l rus` option specifies that the language used for recognition is Russian.

## Code explanation


1. `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-rus`: This command is used to download and install the Russian language data files.
2. `tesseract input_image.jpg output_text -l rus`: This command is used to recognize Russian text from an input image file and output the recognized text in a file. The `-l rus` option specifies that the language used for recognition is Russian.
