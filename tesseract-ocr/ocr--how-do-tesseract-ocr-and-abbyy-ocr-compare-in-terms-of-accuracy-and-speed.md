OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that enables machines to read text from images and documents. Tesseract OCR and Abbyy OCR are two popular OCR solutions available.

In terms of accuracy, Tesseract OCR is known to have higher accuracy than Abbyy OCR for certain languages like English and French. However, Abbyy OCR is more accurate than Tesseract for other languages like Chinese and Japanese.

In terms of speed, Tesseract OCR is faster than Abbyy OCR in most cases. This is because Tesseract OCR is an open source solution, while Abbyy OCR is a commercial solution.

For example, the following code block shows how to use Tesseract OCR to extract text from an image:
```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open('example.jpg')
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
print(text)
```
The output of this example code would be the text extracted from the image.

In conclusion, Tesseract OCR is more accurate for certain languages and faster than Abbyy OCR, while Abbyy OCR is more accurate for other languages.
