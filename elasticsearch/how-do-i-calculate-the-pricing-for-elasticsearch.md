# How do I calculate the pricing for Elasticsearch?
// plain

The pricing for Elasticsearch depends on the type of deployment (e.g. self-managed, cloud, etc.), the number of nodes, and the size of the nodes. For self-managed deployments, the cost of the hardware and software must be taken into account. For cloud deployments, the cost of the cloud service must be considered.

For example, if you are using a self-managed deployment with two nodes each with 32GB of RAM, the cost of the hardware and software must be calculated. The cost of the hardware would be the cost of two servers with 32GB of RAM, plus the cost of the Elasticsearch software.

If you are using a cloud deployment, the cost of the cloud service must be calculated. For example, if you are using Amazon Elasticsearch Service, the cost of the service is based on the number of nodes, the size of the nodes, and the storage used.

Below is an example of how to calculate the pricing for Amazon Elasticsearch Service using the AWS CLI.

```
aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain-config --domain-name mydomain
```

Example output:

```
{
    "DomainConfig": {
        "ElasticsearchClusterConfig": {
            "InstanceType": "r5.large.elasticsearch",
            "InstanceCount": 2,
            "DedicatedMasterEnabled": false,
            "ZoneAwarenessEnabled": false
        },
        "EBSOptions": {
            "EBSEnabled": true,
            "VolumeType": "gp2",
            "VolumeSize": 10
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the cost of the Amazon Elasticsearch Service would be calculated as follows:

1. Instance type: r5.large.elasticsearch - [$0.192 per hour](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/pricing/)
2. Instance count: 2 - [$0.384 per hour](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/pricing/)
3. Volume type: gp2 - [$0.10 per GB-month](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/)
4. Volume size: 10 GB - [$1.00 per month](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/)

Therefore, the cost of the Amazon Elasticsearch Service in this example would be $0.576 per hour + $1.00 per month.
