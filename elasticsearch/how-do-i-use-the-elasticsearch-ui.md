# How do I use the Elasticsearch UI?
// plain

Elasticsearch UI is a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for managing and monitoring your Elasticsearch clusters. It provides a web-based console for creating and managing indices, analyzing data, and running queries.

To use the Elasticsearch UI, you need to install the Kibana plugin. Kibana is an open source data visualization platform that allows you to explore and visualize your Elasticsearch data.

Here is an example of how to use the Elasticsearch UI:

1. Install the Kibana plugin.

```
bin/kibana-plugin install x-pack
```

2. Start the Kibana server.

```
bin/kibana
```

3. Access the Kibana UI in your web browser. The default URL is http://localhost:5601.

4. Create an index pattern to access your data.

5. Explore and visualize your data using the UI.

For more information about using the Elasticsearch UI, see the [Kibana User Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html).
