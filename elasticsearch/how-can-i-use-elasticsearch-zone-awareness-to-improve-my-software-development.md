# How can I use elasticsearch zone awareness to improve my software development?
// plain

Elasticsearch zone awareness can be used to improve software development by allowing developers to create clusters that are aware of their physical environment. This means that nodes in the same zone can be grouped together for better performance, while nodes in different zones can be isolated for better scalability and availability.

For example, if you have a cluster with nodes in two different data centers, you can use zone awareness to ensure that nodes in the same data center are grouped together. This can improve performance, since nodes in the same zone can communicate more quickly than nodes in different zones.

## Example code

```
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes": "zone"
  }
}
```

## Output example

```
{
  "acknowledged": true
}
```

The code above sets the cluster's routing allocation awareness attribute to `zone`, which tells Elasticsearch to group nodes in the same zone together.

You can also use the `cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.zone.values` setting to specify which zones are available in your cluster. For example, if you have two data centers, `dc1` and `dc2`, you can set this value to `["dc1", "dc2"]` to ensure that nodes in each data center are grouped together.
