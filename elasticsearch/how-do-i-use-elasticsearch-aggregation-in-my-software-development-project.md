# How do I use elasticsearch aggregation in my software development project?
// plain

Elasticsearch aggregation is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze and process data in a software development project. It allows users to group data by specific fields, perform calculations on the data, and return the results in a structured format.

## Example code

```javascript
GET /_search
{
  "aggs": {
    "group_by_state": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "state"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Output example

```json
{
  ...
  "aggregations" : {
    "group_by_state" : {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound" : 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count" : 0,
      "buckets" : [
        {
          "key" : "CA",
          "doc_count" : 2
        },
        {
          "key" : "NY",
          "doc_count" : 1
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The example code above uses the `GET` method to retrieve all documents in the index, and then uses the `aggs` parameter to group the documents by the `state` field. The output is a JSON object with the `aggregations` key, which contains the `group_by_state` aggregation with a list of buckets. Each bucket contains the `key` (the value of the `state` field) and the `doc_count` (the number of documents with that value).
