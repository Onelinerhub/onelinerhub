# How can I use Elasticsearch with Django?
// plain

Elasticsearch can be used with Django to enable powerful search capabilities for web applications. The following steps can be taken to get started:

1. Install the Elasticsearch Python library:
```
pip install elasticsearch
```

2. Create a search index in Elasticsearch for your Django model:
```
from elasticsearch_dsl import Index

my_index = Index('my_index')
my_index.doc_type(MyModel)
my_index.create()
```

3. Create a search query for your model:
```
from elasticsearch_dsl import Search

s = Search(index='my_index')
s = s.query('match', title='My Title')
```

4. Execute the query and retrieve the results:
```
response = s.execute()
results = response.hits
```

5. Iterate through the results and display them:
```
for result in results:
    print(result.title)
```

You can find more information about using Elasticsearch with Django in the [Elasticsearch Python documentation](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
