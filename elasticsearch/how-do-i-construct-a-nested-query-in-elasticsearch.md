# How do I construct a nested query in Elasticsearch?
// plain

Nested queries in Elasticsearch allow you to query nested objects and return nested objects as part of your search results. This can be useful when you want to search through a collection of nested objects and return the matching nested objects.

To construct a nested query in Elasticsearch, you need to specify the `nested` query type in your search query. Here is an example of a nested query:

```
GET my_index/_search
{
    "query": {
        "nested": {
            "path": "nested_object",
            "query": {
                "match": {
                    "nested_object.name": "John"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This query will search within the `nested_object` field for any documents that have a `name` field with the value of `John`.

Here is an explanation of the parts of the query:

* `GET my_index/_search` - This is the endpoint for the search query.
* `query` - This is the main query object.
* `nested` - This is the type of the query.
* `path` - This is the field that the nested query should search within.
* `query` - This is the query that will be used to search within the nested object.
* `match` - This is the type of query that will be used to search within the nested object.
* `nested_object.name` - This is the field that will be searched for the value of `John`.
