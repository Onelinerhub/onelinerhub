# How do I use GitHub with Elasticsearch?
// plain

GitHub can be used with Elasticsearch to manage source code, track and manage issues, and collaborate with other developers.

To use GitHub with Elasticsearch, you will need to first create a repository on GitHub and then clone it to your local machine. You can then use the Elasticsearch API to index documents and make queries.

Here is an example of how to index a document in Elasticsearch using the GitHub API:

```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/my_index/my_type/1" -d '
{
    "title": "My Document",
    "content": "This is the content of my document"
}'
```

This will create a document with the title "My Document" and the content "This is the content of my document" in the index "my_index" and type "my_type".

To make a query using the GitHub API, you can use the following command:

```
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/my_index/_search?q=content:my%20document"
```

This will return a JSON object containing the results of the query.

You can also use the GitHub API to manage issues and collaborate with other developers. For more information on how to use GitHub with Elasticsearch, please see the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/git-repository.html).
