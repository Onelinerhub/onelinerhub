# How do I group data using Elasticsearch?
// plain

Grouping data in Elasticsearch is a powerful way to aggregate and analyze data. To do this, you need to use the `aggregations` feature of Elasticsearch. Aggregations allow you to group data by a certain criteria, such as a certain field or range of values.

For example, the following code will group documents by the `color` field:
```
GET /_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "colors": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "color"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The output of this query will look something like this:
```
{
  ...
  "aggregations": {
    "colors": {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "red",
          "doc_count": 10
        },
        {
          "key": "blue",
          "doc_count": 5
        },
        {
          "key": "green",
          "doc_count": 3
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `GET /_search` - This is the endpoint used to query Elasticsearch.
2. `size: 0` - This tells Elasticsearch to not return any documents, just the aggregations.
3. `aggs` - This is the object that contains the aggregation definitions.
4. `terms` - This is the type of aggregation used. It groups documents by a certain field.
5. `field` - This is the field that the documents will be grouped by.

For more information about Elasticsearch aggregations, please refer to [the official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html).
