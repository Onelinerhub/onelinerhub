# How can I use Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana together to analyze my data?
// plain

Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) can be used together to analyze data. Here is an example of how to do it:

1. First, you need to send your data to Elasticsearch using Logstash. You can do this with a configuration file like this:

```
input {
  file {
    path => "/path/to/your/data/*"
    start_position => "beginning"
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
    index => "your_index_name"
  }
}
```

2. Once the data is stored in Elasticsearch, you can access it using Kibana. Kibana provides an interface for exploring and visualizing your data.

3. You can use Kibana to build dashboards and perform analysis on your data. For example, you can create charts, tables, and maps to visualize your data.

4. You can also use Kibana to create alerts and notifications. This allows you to be notified when certain conditions are met in your data.

5. Finally, you can use Kibana to share your analysis with others. You can create public dashboards that can be accessed by anyone with the link.

By using ELK together, you can analyze your data in powerful ways.
