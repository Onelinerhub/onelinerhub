# How do I install Elasticsearch using npm?
// plain

Installing Elasticsearch using npm is a relatively simple process.

First, you need to ensure you have npm installed. To check, open a terminal and run the command:
```
npm -v
```
If npm is installed, you should see the version number printed.

Once npm is installed, you can install Elasticsearch using the npm install command. For example:
```
npm install elasticsearch
```
This will install the latest version of Elasticsearch.

You can also specify a specific version of Elasticsearch to install. For example, to install version 7.3.2:
```
npm install elasticsearch@7.3.2
```

After the installation is complete, you can check that it was successful by running the command:
```
npm list elasticsearch
```
This will print out the version of Elasticsearch that is installed.

Finally, you can start the Elasticsearch server by running the command:
```
npm start elasticsearch
```
