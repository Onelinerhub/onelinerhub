# How do I configure the XMX setting for Elasticsearch?
// plain

The XMX setting is used to configure the maximum amount of memory that the Elasticsearch process can use. This setting is important as it can affect the performance of your cluster.

To configure the XMX setting, you can use the `ES_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable. For example, to set the maximum memory to 8GB, you can use the following command:

```
export ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx8g"
```

The following list explains the parts of this command:
- `export`: This is a command used to set environment variables.
- `ES_JAVA_OPTS`: This is the environment variable used to set the Java options for Elasticsearch.
- `-Xmx`: This is the Java option used to set the maximum memory.
- `8g`: This is the amount of memory to set, in this case 8GB.

For more information about configuring the XMX setting, see the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/heap-size.html).
