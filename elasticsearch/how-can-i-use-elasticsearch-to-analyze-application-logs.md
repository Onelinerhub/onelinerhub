# How can I use Elasticsearch to analyze application logs?
// plain

Elasticsearch can be used to analyze application logs by using its powerful search and analytics capabilities.

For example, you can use the following code to search for application logs in Elasticsearch:
```
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "message": "application log"
    }
  }
}
```
The output of the above query will be a list of application logs stored in Elasticsearch.

You can also use the following code to analyze application logs in Elasticsearch:
```
GET /_search
{
  "aggs": {
    "application_logs": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "message"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The output of the above query will be a list of application logs along with the number of times each log was encountered.

The following are the parts of the code used to analyze application logs in Elasticsearch:

* `GET /_search` - This command retrieves the search results from Elasticsearch.
* `query` - This is the query that is used to search for application logs in Elasticsearch.
* `aggs` - This is used to define the aggregation that will be used to analyze the application logs.
* `terms` - This is used to define the field that will be used to group the application logs.
