# How can I use elasticsearch efficiently?
// plain

Elasticsearch can be used efficiently in a number of ways. Here are some tips to get the most out of Elasticsearch:

1. Make sure your data is properly indexed. Indexing is the process of organizing data in a way that makes it easy to search. This includes creating mappings for fields and setting up the right analyzers.

2. Use the right query types for the job. Different query types are better suited for different tasks, such as using a match query for full-text search or a term query for exact matches.

3. Utilize caching and batching. Caching and batching can improve the performance of your queries by reducing the number of requests sent to the server.

4. Use sharding for large data sets. Sharding is a way of distributing data across multiple nodes. This can help improve the speed and scalability of your queries.

5. Take advantage of aggregations. Aggregations can be used to quickly group and summarize data, making it easier to analyze and visualize.

6. Monitor your cluster. Monitoring your cluster can help you identify issues and optimize performance.

7. Use the right tools. There are a number of tools available for working with Elasticsearch, such as Kibana and Logstash.

Here is an example of using a match query to search for a document in Elasticsearch:

```
POST /my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "elasticsearch"
    }
  }
}
```

## Output example

```
{
  "took": 3,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 1,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.2876821,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "my_index",
        "_type": "_doc",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 0.2876821,
        "_source": {
          "title": "Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
