# How do I use elasticsearch watermark to track changes in my software development project?
// plain

Elasticsearch Watermark is a feature that allows you to track changes in your software development project. It works by creating a timestamp that is associated with each change made to the project. This timestamp can then be used to query the project's history, allowing you to easily find out when changes were made and who made them.

To use Elasticsearch Watermark, you first need to create a watermark document. This document should contain a timestamp field and any other fields that you want to track. For example:

```
PUT my_index/_doc/1
{
  "timestamp": "2020-08-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Once the watermark document is created, you can start tracking changes to your project. Every time a change is made, you should update the watermark document with the new timestamp. For example:

```
PUT my_index/_doc/1
{
  "timestamp": "2020-08-02T12:00:00Z"
}
```

You can then use the timestamp field in the watermark document to query the project's history. For example:

```
GET my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "timestamp": {
        "gte": "2020-08-01T12:00:00Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return all documents that were created after the timestamp specified in the watermark document.

By using Elasticsearch Watermark, you can easily track changes to your software development project and quickly find out when changes were made and who made them.
