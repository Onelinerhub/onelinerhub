# How do elasticsearch and manticore compare in terms of software development?
// plain

Elasticsearch and Manticore are both open source search engines. Elasticsearch is built on top of Apache Lucene and is written in Java, while Manticore is written in C++ and is based on Sphinx.

In terms of software development, Elasticsearch is more popular and has a larger user base, so there is more community support and more resources available. It also has a larger feature set and more advanced features, such as support for distributed search and real-time analytics.

Manticore, on the other hand, is more lightweight and faster than Elasticsearch, and is better suited for applications that require low latency. It also has a smaller memory footprint and is more flexible than Elasticsearch.

Example code using Elasticsearch:
```
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
es = Elasticsearch()

res = es.search(index="my_index", body={"query": {"match_all": {}}})
print(res)
```
## Output example

```
{'took': 3, 'timed_out': False, '_shards': {'total': 5, 'successful': 5, 'skipped': 0, 'failed': 0}, 'hits': {'total': {'value': 2, 'relation': 'eq'}, 'max_score': 1.0, 'hits': [{'_index': 'my_index', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '1', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'title': 'Document 1'}}, {'_index': 'my_index', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '2', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'title': 'Document 2'}}]}}
```

The code above uses the Elasticsearch library to search for all documents in the "my_index" index. The output is a JSON object containing the search results.

Example code using Manticore:
```
from manticore import Manticore
mc = Manticore()

res = mc.search("my_index", "query")
print(res)
```
## Output example

```
[{'_index': 'my_index', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '1', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'title': 'Document 1'}}, {'_index': 'my_index', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '2', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'title': 'Document 2'}}]
```

The code above uses the Manticore library to search for all documents in the "my_index" index. The output is a list of documents containing the search results.

In conclusion, Elasticsearch is more popular and feature-rich, while Manticore is more lightweight and faster. Both are suitable for different types of software development, depending on the application requirements.
