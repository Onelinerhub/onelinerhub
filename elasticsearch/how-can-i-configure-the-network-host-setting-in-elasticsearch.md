# How can I configure the network.host setting in Elasticsearch?
// plain

The `network.host` setting in Elasticsearch is used to configure the IP address that the node binds to. This setting can be configured in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.

For example, if the IP address of the node is `192.168.1.1`, the following code can be used to configure the `network.host` setting:

```
network.host: 192.168.1.1
```

The following parts of the code should be noted:

- `network.host`: This is the setting that should be configured.
- `192.168.1.1`: This is the IP address that the node will bind to.

It is also possible to configure the `network.host` setting to accept requests from all IP addresses. This can be done by using the following code:

```
network.host: 0.0.0.0
```

The following parts of the code should be noted:

- `network.host`: This is the setting that should be configured.
- `0.0.0.0`: This is the IP address that the node will bind to, which will accept requests from all IP addresses.

For more information on configuring the `network.host` setting in Elasticsearch, please refer to the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html).
