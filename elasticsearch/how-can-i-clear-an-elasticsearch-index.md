# How can I clear an elasticsearch index?
// plain

1. To clear an Elasticsearch index, use the `DELETE` request to delete the index.
    ```
    DELETE /<index_name>
    ```
    This will delete the index and all of its documents.

2. To delete all the documents in the index without deleting the index itself, use the `DELETE` request with the `_doc` endpoint.
    ```
    DELETE /<index_name>/_doc
    ```
    This will delete all documents in the index but the index itself will remain.

3. To delete documents that match a certain criteria, use the `DELETE` request with the `_delete_by_query` endpoint.
    ```
    DELETE /<index_name>/_delete_by_query
    {
        "query": {
            "match": {
                "field_name": "field_value"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    This will delete all documents that match the query criteria, but the index itself will remain.

4. To delete documents in bulk, use the `DELETE` request with the `_bulk` endpoint.
    ```
    DELETE /<index_name>/_bulk
    { "delete" : { "_id" : "1" } }
    { "delete" : { "_id" : "2" } }
    { "delete" : { "_id" : "3" } }
    ```
    This will delete the specified documents in bulk, but the index itself will remain.

5. To delete all documents in an index and recreate the index, use the `DELETE` request with the `_all` endpoint.
    ```
    DELETE /_all
    ```
    This will delete all documents in the index and recreate the index.

6. To delete an index, use the `DELETE` request to delete the index.
    ```
    DELETE /<index_name>
    ```
    This will delete the index and all of its documents.

7. To delete an index permanently, use the `DELETE` request with the `_force` endpoint.
    ```
    DELETE /<index_name>/_force
    ```
    This will delete the index and all of its documents permanently, and the index cannot be recovered.
