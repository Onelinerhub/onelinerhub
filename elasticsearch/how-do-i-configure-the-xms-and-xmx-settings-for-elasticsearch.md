# How do I configure the Xms and Xmx settings for Elasticsearch?
// plain

The Xms and Xmx settings for Elasticsearch can be configured by setting the `ES_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable. For example, to set the minimum and maximum heap size to 4GB and 8GB respectively, the following command can be used:

```
export ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms4g -Xmx8g"
```

The `ES_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable takes two parameters, `-Xms` and `-Xmx`, which set the minimum and maximum heap size respectively. The heap size is the amount of memory allocated to the Elasticsearch process. Setting the minimum and maximum heap size helps to ensure that the process does not run out of memory and can be adjusted depending on the size of the cluster and the available memory.

It is important to note that the heap size should not be set to more than 50% of the total available memory on the machine, as this can cause the Elasticsearch process to crash.
