How do I use the Elasticsearch Head plugin?
// plain

The Elasticsearch Head plugin is a web front end for browsing and interacting with an Elasticsearch cluster. It provides a convenient graphical user interface for performing various operations such as creating, deleting, viewing, and modifying indices, managing documents, and running queries.

To use the plugin, first you must install it. This can be done by running the following command in the directory where your Elasticsearch is installed:
```
bin/plugin install mobz/elasticsearch-head
```
This will install the plugin and start it. You can then access it by navigating to `http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/` in your web browser.

Once the plugin is loaded, you can start using it. The main page will show you the list of indices in the cluster and you can select any of them to view its contents. You can also search for documents in the indices, delete documents, and create new indices.
