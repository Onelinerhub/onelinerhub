# How do I create a backup of my Elasticsearch data?
// plain

Creating a backup of Elasticsearch data is an important step in ensuring that your data is not lost in the event of an unexpected failure or system crash.

To create a backup of your Elasticsearch data, you will need to use the Elasticsearch snapshot API. This API allows you to create a snapshot of your data and store it in a repository.

The following example code shows how to create a snapshot of your data and store it in a repository called "my_backup_repository":
```
PUT _snapshot/my_backup_repository
{
  "type": "fs",
  "settings": {
    "location": "/path/to/backup/location"
  }
}
```

The output should look like this:
```
{
  "acknowledged": true
}
```

To actually take the snapshot, you will need to issue a snapshot request to the repository. This can be done with the following code:

```
PUT _snapshot/my_backup_repository/snapshot_1
{
  "indices": "index_1,index_2",
  "ignore_unavailable": true,
  "include_global_state": false
}
```

The output should look like this:
```
{
  "accepted": true
}
```

The code above will create a snapshot of the indices "index_1" and "index_2" and store it in the repository "my_backup_repository". The "ignore_unavailable" parameter will cause the snapshot to ignore unavailable shards, and the "include_global_state" parameter will determine whether the global cluster state is included in the snapshot.

For more information about creating backups with the Elasticsearch snapshot API, please refer to the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html).
