# How can I use OpenSearch with Elasticsearch?
// plain

OpenSearch is a powerful search engine that can be used with Elasticsearch to provide a more robust search experience. It is a distributed search engine that allows for faster data retrieval and more efficient search results.

Using OpenSearch with Elasticsearch is simple. All that is required is to add the OpenSearch plugin to the Elasticsearch configuration file. The following code block shows an example of how to do this:

```
# Add OpenSearch plugin
plugin install org.elasticsearch.plugin:opensearch:1.6.0
```

Once the plugin is installed, the OpenSearch API can be used to query the Elasticsearch index. The following code block shows an example of how to do this:

```
POST /_opensearch
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "Elasticsearch"
    }
  }
}
```

The output of this query would be a list of documents from the Elasticsearch index that match the query criteria.

## Code explanation

1. `plugin install org.elasticsearch.plugin:opensearch:1.6.0` - This line of code is used to install the OpenSearch plugin into the Elasticsearch configuration file.
2. `POST /_opensearch` - This line of code is used to make a POST request to the OpenSearch API.
3. `"query": { "match": { "title": "Elasticsearch" } }` - This is the query criteria that is sent with the POST request. It specifies that documents with a title field containing the word "Elasticsearch" should be returned.
