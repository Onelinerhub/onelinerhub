1. **Indexing:** Create indices with the appropriate number of shards and replicas. Use a naming convention for all indices and be sure to check the index settings before creating an index.

2. **Mapping:** Define the mapping for each index, including the data types and the index and search analyzers.

3. **Data Ingestion:** Use the bulk API to ingest data into Elasticsearch. This will ensure that data is ingested efficiently and can be monitored for errors.

4. **Search:** Use the multi-match query for searching multiple fields. Additionally, use the bool query for combining multiple queries.

5. **Security:** Use X-Pack for securing Elasticsearch clusters. This will enable authentication, authorization, and encryption for the cluster.

6. **Monitoring:** Use the monitoring API to monitor the performance of the cluster. This will enable you to identify any issues and take corrective action.

7. **Backup:** Use the snapshot API to take periodic backups of the cluster. This will ensure that the data is always recoverable in case of an emergency.

## Example code

```
PUT my_index
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 5,
    "number_of_replicas": 1
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "english"
      },
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "english"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## Output example

```
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "shards_acknowledged": true,
  "index": "my_index"
}
```
