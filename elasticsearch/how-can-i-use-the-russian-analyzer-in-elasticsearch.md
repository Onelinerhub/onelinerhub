# How can I use the Russian Analyzer in Elasticsearch?
// plain

The Russian Analyzer in Elasticsearch can be used to analyze and tokenize Russian language texts. It is a part of the Elasticsearch's Analysis API, which provides a framework for customizing language analysis.

To use the Russian Analyzer in Elasticsearch, you need to specify the name of the analyzer in the mapping of the index. For example:

```
PUT my_index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "russian"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will set the title field of the index to use the Russian Analyzer.

You can then use the analyzed tokens in search queries. For example:

```
GET my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "привет"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will search for documents that contain the token `привет` (which will be tokenized into `привет` by the Russian Analyzer).

## Code explanation


1. `PUT my_index` - This command creates an index called `my_index`.
2. `"analyzer": "russian"` - This sets the analyzer of the title field to `russian`, which will use the Russian Analyzer.
3. `GET my_index/_search` - This command searches the `my_index` index.
4. `"query": "привет"` - This sets the query string to `привет`, which will be tokenized by the Russian Analyzer.
