# How can I resolve unassigned shards in Elasticsearch?
// plain

Unassigned shards in Elasticsearch can be resolved by performing a cluster re-routing operation. This will cause the cluster to re-allocate the shards to the available nodes. To do this, use the `Cluster Reroute API` with the `allocate_stale_primary` option. This will cause the cluster to try to re-allocate any unassigned shards to their primary node:

```
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_cluster/reroute?retry_failed&pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "commands" : [
    {
      "allocate_stale_primary" : {
        "index" : "my_index",
        "shard" : 0,
        "node" : "node_name",
        "accept_data_loss" : true
      }
    }
  ]
}
'
```

The output of this command will be something like this:
```
{
  "state" : "yellow",
  "allocated_shards" : 3,
  "unassigned_shards" : 0
}
```

This indicates that the cluster re-routing operation was successful and all shards have been assigned to nodes.

Parts of the code:
- `curl`: command used to make a request to the Elasticsearch API
- `-XPOST`: flag used to specify the type of request being made (in this case, a POST request)
- `localhost:9200`: address of the Elasticsearch cluster
- `_cluster/reroute`: endpoint of the Cluster Reroute API
- `retry_failed`: flag used to retry failed re-routing operations
- `allocate_stale_primary`: command used to re-allocate unassigned shards
- `index`: name of the index containing the unassigned shards
- `shard`: number of the shard to be re-allocated
- `node`: name of the node to which the shard should be re-allocated
- `accept_data_loss`: flag used to indicate that data loss is acceptable
