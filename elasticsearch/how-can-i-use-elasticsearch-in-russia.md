# How can I use Elasticsearch in Russia?
// plain

Elasticsearch can be used in Russia to build powerful search applications that scale quickly and easily. To get started, you'll need to install the Elasticsearch software on your server. Once installed, you can use the Elasticsearch APIs to index and search your data.

For example, the following code will create an index called `russia_index` and add a document to it:

```
PUT russia_index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "content": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}

PUT russia_index/_doc/1
{
  "title": "Using Elasticsearch in Russia",
  "content": "Elasticsearch can be used in Russia to build powerful search applications that scale quickly and easily."
}
```

The code above will create an index called `russia_index` with two fields - `title` and `content`. It will then add a document with the title "Using Elasticsearch in Russia" and the content "Elasticsearch can be used in Russia to build powerful search applications that scale quickly and easily."

Once the index is created, you can use the Elasticsearch APIs to search your data. For example, the following code will search for documents with the term "Russia":

```
GET russia_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "content": "Russia"
    }
  }
}
```

The output of this code will be a list of documents that match the search term "Russia".
