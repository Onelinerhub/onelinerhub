# How can I use the Elasticsearch DSL to build custom search queries?
// plain

The Elasticsearch DSL (Domain Specific Language) is a powerful query language for creating custom search queries. It provides a simple, powerful syntax for constructing complex queries.

Here is an example of a query using the Elasticsearch DSL:

```
GET /_search
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "title": "Elasticsearch"
        }
    }
}
```
This query will return all documents that have the word "Elasticsearch" in the `title` field.

The parts of the query are:
* `GET` - The HTTP method used to execute the query
* `/_search` - The endpoint that is used to execute the query
* `query` - The query clause that contains the search criteria
* `match` - The type of query used to match documents
* `title` - The field that is matched against the query
* `Elasticsearch` - The query string that is used to match documents

For more information on the Elasticsearch DSL, please see the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html).
