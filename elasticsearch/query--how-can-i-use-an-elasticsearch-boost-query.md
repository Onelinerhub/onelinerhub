How can I use an Elasticsearch boost query?
// plain

A boost query is a type of query that allows you to increase the relevance of certain documents in the search results. It is used to give more weight to certain documents or fields when using the Elasticsearch query DSL.

The syntax for a boost query is as follows:

```
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "field_name": {
              "query": "search_term",
              "boost": "boost_value"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `field_name` is the name of the field that you want to give a boost to, the `search_term` is the term that you want to search for, and the `boost_value` is the amount of boost that you want to give to that field. The higher the boost value, the more relevant the documents with that field will be in the search results.

The output of this query will be a list of documents that match the search term, with the documents that have the field with the higher boost value appearing higher in the search results.

Here's a list of parts and their explanation:

- `query`: This is the top-level JSON object that contains the query.
- `bool`: This is the boolean operator that contains the `should` clause that contains the boost query.
- `should`: This is the clause that contains the boost query.
- `match`: This is the query type that contains the field name, search term, and boost value.
- `field_name`: This is the name of the field that you want to give a boost to.
- `search_term`: This is the term that you want to search for.
- `boost_value`: This is the amount of boost that you want to give to that field.
