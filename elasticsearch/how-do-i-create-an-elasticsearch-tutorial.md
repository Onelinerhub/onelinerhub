# How do I create an Elasticsearch tutorial?
// plain

1. Start by creating a new directory and cloning the official Elasticsearch repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch.git
```

2. Set up a development environment by following the [Elasticsearch setup guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html).

3. Create a new file, `tutorial.md`, and write a brief introduction to Elasticsearch.

4. Write a step-by-step guide for creating an index and adding documents to it. Include code blocks for each step and explain each part of the code.

```
# Create an index
PUT /blog

# Add a document
PUT /blog/post/1
{
  "title": "My first post",
  "body": "This is the body of my first post"
}
```

5. Provide examples of queries and explain each part of the query.

```
# Match query
GET /blog/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "first post"
    }
  }
}
```

6. Include a list of useful resources at the end of the tutorial.

7. Test the tutorial and make sure everything works as expected.
