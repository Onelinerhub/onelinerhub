# How do I find the best book about Elasticsearch?
// plain

The best book about Elasticsearch depends on the reader's needs. For those who are just getting started with Elasticsearch, I recommend [Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html) by Clinton Gormley and Zachary Tong. It provides an in-depth overview of Elasticsearch, from installation to data indexing and query optimization.

For those who need a more advanced guide, I recommend [Elasticsearch in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elasticsearch-in-action) by Radu Gheorghe, Matthew Lee Hinman, and Roy Russo. This book goes beyond the basics and covers topics such as data analysis and advanced query optimization.

For those who are interested in the internals of Elasticsearch, I recommend [Elasticsearch Server](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/elasticsearch-server-third-edition) by Rafal Kuc. This book covers topics such as cluster architecture, distributed search, and indexing strategies.

For those who need a comprehensive guide to all aspects of Elasticsearch, I recommend [Elasticsearch Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/elasticsearch-cookbook-third-edition) by Alberto Paro. This book covers topics such as installation, data indexing, query optimization, and data analysis.

Finally, for those who need to learn the basics of Elasticsearch quickly, I recommend [Getting Started with Elasticsearch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781787122055/) by Bharvi Dixit. This book covers the fundamentals of Elasticsearch in an easy-to-understand format.

No matter which book you choose, you can be sure that you will get the best possible introduction to Elasticsearch.

```
Example code

GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```

## Output example

```
{
  "took" : 3,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 5,
    "successful" : 5,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 10,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "my_index",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "My Document"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "my_index",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Another Document"
        }
      },
      // more results
    ]
  }
}
```

## Code explanation

* `GET /_search` - This is the API endpoint used to query Elasticsearch.
* `{ "query": { "match_all": {} } }` - This is the query that is sent to Elasticsearch. It is a simple query that matches all documents in the index.
* `"took" : 3` - This is the amount of time it took for Elasticsearch to process the query.
* `"total" : { "value" : 10, "relation" : "eq" }` - This is the total number of documents that matched the query.
* `"hits" : [ { "_index" : "my_index", "_type" : "_doc", "_id" : "1", "_score" : 1.0, "_source" : { "title" : "My Document" } }, { "_index" : "my_index", "_type" : "_doc", "_id" : "2", "_score" : 1.0, "_source" : { "title" : "Another Document" } }, // more results ]` - This is the list of documents that matched the query. Each document has an index, type, ID, score, and source.
