# How do I use the elasticsearch exporter to export data?
// plain

The Elasticsearch exporter is a tool for exporting data from an Elasticsearch cluster. It provides a simple way to export data from an Elasticsearch cluster to a variety of formats, such as JSON, CSV, and XLSX.

To use the exporter, first install it from the Elasticsearch website:

```
$ bin/elasticsearch-exporter install
```

Once installed, the exporter can be used to export data from an Elasticsearch cluster. The following example exports data from the `my_index` index to a JSON file:

```
$ bin/elasticsearch-exporter export --index my_index --output my_index.json
```

The exporter supports a variety of options for controlling the output format, such as `--format` to specify the output format (e.g. `json`, `csv`, or `xlsx`) and `--fields` to specify which fields to include in the output.

The exporter also supports a variety of options for filtering the data to be exported, such as `--query` to specify a query string for filtering the data and `--filter` to specify a filter object for filtering the data.

For more information, see the [Elasticsearch exporter documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/exporters.html).
