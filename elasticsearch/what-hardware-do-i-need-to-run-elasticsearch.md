# What hardware do I need to run Elasticsearch?
// plain

In order to run Elasticsearch, you need to have the following hardware:

1. A computer with at least 4GB of RAM and a modern processor, such as an Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron.

2. A hard drive with at least 10GB of free space for the Elasticsearch installation files.

3. A network connection to access the Elasticsearch cluster.

4. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or higher.

5. An internet connection to download the Elasticsearch installation files.

You can check to see if your system meets the minimum requirements for running Elasticsearch by running the following command:

```
java -version
```

This will output something like:

```
java version "1.8.0_231"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_231-b11)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.231-b11, mixed mode)
```

If the output of this command shows that you are running Java version 8 or higher, then your system meets the minimum requirements for running Elasticsearch.

For more information on the hardware requirements for running Elasticsearch, please see the [Elasticsearch Reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/hardware.html).
