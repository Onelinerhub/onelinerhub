# How can I use Elasticsearch and Zookeeper together to manage distributed applications?
// plain

Elasticsearch and Zookeeper can be used together to manage distributed applications. Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine and Zookeeper is a distributed coordination service. The two can be used together to build a distributed application that can scale and maintain data consistency.

For example, you can use Zookeeper to manage the cluster state of Elasticsearch and to ensure that the nodes in the cluster are up-to-date. Zookeeper can also be used to manage the configuration of Elasticsearch nodes and to ensure that the nodes are running the correct version of Elasticsearch.

```
# Initialize the Zookeeper client
zk = KazooClient(hosts='127.0.0.1:2181')
zk.start()

# Create a znode for the Elasticsearch cluster
zk.create("/elasticsearch", b"my elasticsearch cluster")
```

This example code will create a znode for the Elasticsearch cluster. The znode will contain the data "my elasticsearch cluster".

- `zk = KazooClient(hosts='127.0.0.1:2181')`: This line initializes the Zookeeper client.
- `zk.start()`: This line starts the Zookeeper client.
- `zk.create("/elasticsearch", b"my elasticsearch cluster")`: This line creates a znode for the Elasticsearch cluster with the data "my elasticsearch cluster".
