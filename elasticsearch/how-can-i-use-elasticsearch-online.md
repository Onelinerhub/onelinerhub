# How can I use Elasticsearch online?
// plain

Elasticsearch can be used online in a number of ways. Here is a list of the most common ways:

1. **Web Application** - You can use Elasticsearch as the backend for a web application. This involves creating an API that interacts with the Elasticsearch cluster. You can then use the API to perform operations such as indexing, searching, and updating documents. For example:

```
# Create an index
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/myindex"

# Index a document
curl -X POST "localhost:9200/myindex/mytype/1" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}'
```

2. **REST API** - You can also use Elasticsearch's REST API to interact with the cluster. This allows you to perform operations such as indexing, searching, and updating documents. For example:

```
# Search for documents
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/myindex/_search" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }
}'

# Output
{
  "took": 2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 1,
    "max_score": 0.2876821,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "myindex",
        "_type": "mytype",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 0.2876821,
        "_source": {
          "name": "John Doe"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3. **Cloud Hosted Solution** - You can also use a cloud hosted solution such as [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/). This allows you to quickly and easily spin up an Elasticsearch cluster in the cloud. You can then use the cluster to perform operations such as indexing, searching, and updating documents.

4. **Elasticsearch Service** - You can also use the [Elasticsearch Service](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service) from Elastic. This is a fully managed service that allows you to quickly and easily spin up an Elasticsearch cluster in the cloud. You can then use the cluster to perform operations such as indexing, searching, and updating documents.

These are the most common ways to use Elasticsearch online. For more information, please see the [Elasticsearch Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html).
