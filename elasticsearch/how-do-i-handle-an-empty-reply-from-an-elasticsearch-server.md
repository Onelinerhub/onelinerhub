# How do I handle an empty reply from an Elasticsearch server?
// plain

When handling an empty reply from an Elasticsearch server, it is important to first check the status of the server using the `GET /` endpoint. If the server is up and running, then the problem may be due to an incorrect query or a lack of data.

In this case, it is important to check the query for any syntax errors, and to ensure that the data exists in the Elasticsearch index before running the query.

For example, the following code block can be used to check the status of an Elasticsearch server:

```
GET /

# Output
{
  "name" : "node-1",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "abc123",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "7.3.2",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "abc123",
    "build_date" : "2019-07-24T19:26:31.508941Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "8.1.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

If the server is not responding, then the problem may be due to a network or server issue. In this case, it is important to check the server logs for any errors or warnings.

Additionally, if the query is correct and the data exists, then the issue may be due to a permission issue. In this case, it is important to check the Elasticsearch index and user permissions to ensure that the user running the query has the correct privileges.
