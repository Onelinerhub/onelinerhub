# How can I use Kibana to visualize data stored in Elasticsearch?
// plain

Kibana is a visualization tool that allows users to quickly and easily create visualizations from their data stored in Elasticsearch.

To use Kibana to visualize data stored in Elasticsearch, you will first need to connect Kibana to your Elasticsearch instance. You can do this by running the following command in the Kibana directory:

```
bin/kibana --elasticsearch.url http://localhost:9200
```

Once connected, you can create visualizations of your data stored in Elasticsearch. You can do this by navigating to the Visualize tab in Kibana and selecting the type of visualization you want to create. For example, if you wanted to create a line chart of your data, you would select "Line" from the list of visualization types. You can then select the fields from your Elasticsearch index that you want to use in the visualization.

Once you have selected the fields you want to use, you can click the "Create" button to generate the visualization. You can then adjust the settings of the visualization, such as the colors, labels, and other properties, to customize it to your liking.

You can also save the visualization for future use. You can do this by clicking the "Save" button in the upper-right corner of the visualization.
