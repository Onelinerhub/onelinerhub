# How can I use Redis to store and retrieve PHP passwords?
// plain

Redis is an in-memory data structure store which can be used to store and retrieve PHP passwords. It is a fast and reliable way to store user passwords securely.

To use Redis to store and retrieve PHP passwords, first you need to install Redis and then add the Redis PHP extension to your PHP installation.

Next, you need to create a Redis connection object and use it to store and retrieve passwords. Here is an example code block:
```php
<?php
// Connect to Redis
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);

// Store a password
$username = 'example';
$password = 'test123';
$redis->set($username, $password);

// Retrieve a password
$password = $redis->get($username);
echo $password; // Outputs 'test123'
?>
```

The code above creates a Redis connection object and uses it to store and retrieve a password for the given username.

## Code explanation

- `$redis = new Redis();` - This creates a new Redis connection object.
- `$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);` - This connects to the Redis server on the localhost on port 6379.
- `$redis->set($username, $password);` - This stores the given username and password in the Redis server.
- `$password = $redis->get($username);` - This retrieves the password for the given username from the Redis server.
