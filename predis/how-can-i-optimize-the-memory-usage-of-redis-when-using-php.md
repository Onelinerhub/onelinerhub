# How can I optimize the memory usage of Redis when using PHP?
// plain

1. Use `Redis::setOption()` to enable the `Redis::OPT_SCAN` option. This will allow you to iterate over keys without loading the entire dataset into memory.

2. Use `Redis::pipeline()` to execute multiple commands in a single transaction. This will reduce the number of requests and therefore the amount of memory used.

3. Use `Redis::expire()` to set a time-to-live (TTL) for keys. This will ensure that keys expire when they are no longer needed, freeing up memory.

4. Use `Redis::memoryUsage()` to get the memory usage of a given key. This will allow you to identify which keys are using the most memory and take appropriate action.

5. Use `Redis::memoryOptimize()` to optimize the memory usage of a given key. This will reduce the memory usage of a key without changing its value.

6. Use `Redis::getOption()` to get the current configuration options. This will allow you to identify any options that are not set optimally for your use case.

7. Use `Redis::config()` to set configuration options. This will allow you to configure Redis to use the optimal settings for your use case.

## Example code

```
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->setOption(Redis::OPT_SCAN, true);
```

## Output example

None
