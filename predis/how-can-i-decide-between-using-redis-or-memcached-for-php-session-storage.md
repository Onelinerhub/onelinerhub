# How can I decide between using Redis or Memcached for PHP session storage?
// plain

When deciding between Redis and Memcached for PHP session storage, there are several factors to consider.

1. Performance: Memcached has a slight advantage in performance due to its simpler architecture, but Redis is also very fast.

2. Data types: Redis offers a greater variety of data types, including hashes, lists, and sets, while Memcached only offers key-value storage.

3. Durability: Redis offers persistence, meaning that data can be stored on disk, while Memcached does not.

4. Security: Redis offers better security features, such as authentication and encryption.

5. Scalability: Redis is more scalable than Memcached, as it can be clustered to increase its capacity.

6. Cost: Memcached is generally cheaper than Redis, as it requires less hardware.

7. Example code:
```
<?php
// Connect to Redis
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);

// Set session data
$redis->set('session_id', 'value');

// Get session data
$value = $redis->get('session_id');
echo $value; // Outputs 'value'
```
