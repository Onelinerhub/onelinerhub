# How can I use PHP and Redis to reduce time_wait?
// plain

PHP and Redis can be used together to reduce time_wait by leveraging Redis' ability to store data in-memory and access it quickly. This allows applications to access data quickly without having to wait for a response from a database.

Example code to access data stored in Redis with PHP:
```php
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);
$data = $redis->get('key');
```

This code will connect to a Redis server, then get the data stored at `key`.

The main benefit of using Redis in this way is that the data can be accessed much faster than if it were stored in a database. This reduces the amount of time that must be spent waiting for a response from the database.

## Code explanation

- `$redis = new Redis();`: This creates a new Redis object
- `$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);`: This connects to a Redis server at the specified address and port
- `$data = $redis->get('key');`: This gets the data stored at `key` from the Redis server
