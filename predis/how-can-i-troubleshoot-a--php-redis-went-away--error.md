# How can I troubleshoot a "PHP Redis went away" error?
// plain

1. To troubleshoot a "PHP Redis went away" error, first check the status of the Redis server. Use the following command to check if the Redis server is running: ```sudo service redis-server status```.

2. If the Redis server is not running, restart it with the command ```sudo service redis-server restart```.

3. Check the Redis configuration file for any errors. The configuration file is usually located at `/etc/redis/redis.conf`.

4. Check the server's memory usage and make sure that it is not exceeding the amount of memory allocated to Redis.

5. Check the server's disk space and make sure that it is not exceeding the amount of disk space allocated to Redis.

6. Check the application's code for any errors that could be causing the "PHP Redis went away" error.

7. If none of the above steps resolves the issue, consider increasing the timeout value for Redis in the configuration file. The timeout value is usually set to `0` by default. Increasing the timeout value may help resolve the issue.
