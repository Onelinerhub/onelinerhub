# How can I use the PHP Redis lrange command to retrieve data from a Redis list?
// plain

The PHP Redis lrange command can be used to retrieve data from a Redis list. It takes two arguments: the list name and the start and end indexes of the elements to be returned. Below is an example of using the lrange command to retrieve the first two elements from a list named "mylist":

```
$redis->lrange("mylist", 0, 1);
```

The output of this command would be an array containing the two elements from the list:

```
Array
(
    [0] => element1
    [1] => element2
)
```
