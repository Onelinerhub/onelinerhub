To check the version of PHP and Redis you are using, you can use the following commands:

1. To check the version of PHP, use the following command:
```
php -v
```
This will output the version of PHP you are using, for example:
```
PHP 7.3.6 (cli) (built: May 24 2019 10:21:52) ( NTS MSVC15 (Visual C++ 2017) x64 )
Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.3.6, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies
```

2. To check the version of Redis, use the following command:
```
redis-cli --version
```
This will output the version of Redis you are using, for example:
