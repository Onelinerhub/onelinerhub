# How can I use PHP and Redis to improve the performance of Nextcloud?
// plain

PHP and Redis can be used together to improve the performance of Nextcloud. Redis can be used to store data in a key-value store, allowing faster retrieval of data. This can be used to cache data and provide faster access to frequently used data.

Example code to store data in Redis:
```
<?php
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);
$redis->set('key', 'value');
$value = $redis->get('key');
echo $value;
```
## Output example

```
value
```

The code above connects to the Redis server, sets a key-value pair and retrieves the value from the key. This can be used to store frequently used data in Redis and reduce the number of database queries.

The Redis server can also be used to store user sessions, allowing faster authentication and reducing the load on the database.
