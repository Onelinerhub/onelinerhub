# How can I use a PHP Redis ORM to access data in my application?
// plain

PHP Redis ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is a library that allows you to access data stored in Redis from your PHP application. It provides an easy to use interface for interacting with your Redis data, allowing you to query, manipulate, and store data using simple PHP methods. Here is an example of how to use the library to access data in your application:

```
<?php

// Create a new instance of the Redis ORM
$redis = new RedisORM();

// Connect to the Redis server
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);

// Get a value from the Redis server
$value = $redis->get('key');

// Set a value in the Redis server
$redis->set('key', 'value');

// Close the connection
$redis->close();

?>
```

The above code will connect to the Redis server, get a value from the server, set a new value in the server, and then close the connection.

The Redis ORM library also provides a variety of other features, such as:

* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
* Transactions
* Pipelining
* Pub/Sub

For more information about the library and how to use it, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis).
