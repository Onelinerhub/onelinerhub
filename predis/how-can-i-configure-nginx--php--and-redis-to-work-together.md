# How can I configure Nginx, PHP, and Redis to work together?
// plain

To configure Nginx, PHP, and Redis to work together, first you need to install all three components.

For Nginx, you can use the following command to install it:
```
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

For PHP, you can use the following command to install it:
```
sudo apt-get install php
```

For Redis, you can use the following command to install it:
```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

Once all three components are installed, you need to configure Nginx to use PHP and Redis. To do this, you need to edit the Nginx configuration file and add the following lines:

```
location ~ \.php$ {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
}

location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6379;
}
```

Finally, you need to restart Nginx for the changes to take effect:
```
sudo service nginx restart
```

This will configure Nginx, PHP, and Redis to work together.

## Code explanation
**
- `location ~ \.php$ {`: This line tells Nginx to match requests for files ending in `.php` and process them using PHP.
- `include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;`: This line includes the configuration file for PHP.
- `fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;`: This line tells Nginx to pass requests for PHP files to the FastCGI process manager.
- `location / {`: This line tells Nginx to match all requests and pass them to the Redis server.
- `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6379;`: This line tells Nginx to pass requests to the Redis server running on the localhost.
- `sudo service nginx restart`: This command restarts Nginx for the changes to take effect.
