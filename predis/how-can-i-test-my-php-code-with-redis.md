# How can I test my PHP code with Redis?
// plain

Testing your PHP code with Redis is a great way to ensure that your code is working as expected. Here is an example of how to do it:

```php
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);
$redis->set('key', 'value');
$value = $redis->get('key');

echo $value; // output: value
```

The code above creates a new Redis instance, connects to it, sets a key-value pair and then retrieves the value. The output of the code is `value`.

To test your code, you can do the following:

1. Create a test environment to simulate different scenarios.
2. Use assertions to check the output of your code.
3. Use automated testing tools like PHPUnit to run your tests.
