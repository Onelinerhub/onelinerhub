How can I use PHP and Redis to implement multi-threading?
// plain

PHP and Redis can be used together to implement multi-threading. This can be done by using the `pcntl_fork()` function in PHP. This function allows the current process to be split into multiple processes. Each process can then be used to run a separate thread.

```php
<?php

$pid = pcntl_fork();

if ($pid == -1) {
    die('could not fork');
} else if ($pid) {
    // parent process
    echo "I'm the parent process\n";
    pcntl_wait($status); //Protect against Zombie children
} else {
    // child process
    echo "I'm the child process\n";
    exit;
}

```
## Output example


```
I'm the parent process
I'm the child process
```

The `pcntl_fork()` function returns the process ID of the child process. The parent process can then use this ID to communicate with the child process. Redis can be used to store data that needs to be shared between the parent and child processes.

Parts of the code:

- `pcntl_fork()`: This function is used to create a new child process.
- `pcntl_wait()`: This function is used to protect the parent process from creating zombie processes.
- `Redis`: This is used to store data that needs to be shared between the parent and child processes.
