# What is the purpose of using PHP and Redis together?
// plain

The purpose of using PHP and Redis together is to create a powerful, fast and efficient web application. Redis is an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache and message broker. PHP is a server-side scripting language used for web development.

By combining the two, developers can create applications that are both fast and reliable. For example, Redis can be used to store data that is frequently accessed and PHP can be used to retrieve and manipulate the data.

Here is an example of code used to store and retrieve data with PHP and Redis:

```php
// Connect to Redis
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);

// Store data
$redis->set('key', 'value');

// Retrieve data
$value = $redis->get('key');
echo $value; // Outputs: "value"
```

The code above first connects to the Redis server, then stores a key-value pair and finally retrieves the value associated with the key.

Using Redis and PHP together can provide many advantages such as:

- Increased performance due to the speed of Redis
- Easy scalability
- Improved reliability due to Redis' persistent data storage
