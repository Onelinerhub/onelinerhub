# How to use mutex in PHP Symfony?
// plain

A Mutex is a synchronization mechanism used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. In PHP Symfony, Mutex can be used to protect critical sections of code from concurrent access.

## Example code

```
$mutex = new \Symfony\Component\Lock\Mutex('my_lock');

if ($mutex->acquire()) {
    // critical section of code
    $mutex->release();
}
```

The example code above will acquire a lock on the resource named 'my_lock' and execute the critical section of code. Once the critical section of code is finished, the lock is released.

## Code explanation


1. `$mutex = new \Symfony\Component\Lock\Mutex('my_lock');` - This line creates a new Mutex object with the name 'my_lock'.

2. `if ($mutex->acquire()) {` - This line attempts to acquire a lock on the resource named 'my_lock'.

3. `// critical section of code` - This is the critical section of code that should be protected from concurrent access.

4. `$mutex->release();` - This line releases the lock on the resource named 'my_lock'.
