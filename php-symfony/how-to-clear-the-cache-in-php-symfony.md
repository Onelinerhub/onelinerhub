# How to clear the cache in PHP Symfony?
// plain

To clear the cache in PHP Symfony, you can use the following command:

```
php bin/console cache:clear
```

This command will clear the cache for the current environment. The output of this command will look something like this:

```
Clearing the cache for the dev environment with debug true

[OK] Cache for the "dev" environment (debug=true) was successfully cleared.
```

The command consists of two parts:

- `cache:clear`: This is the command to clear the cache.
- `php bin/console`: This is the command to run the Symfony console.

You can also clear the cache for a specific environment by adding the `--env` option to the command, like this:

```
php bin/console cache:clear --env=prod
```

For more information, please refer to the [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/cache.html).
