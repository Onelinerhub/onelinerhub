# How to create tests in Symfony with PHP?
// plain

Creating tests in Symfony with PHP is a great way to ensure that your application is working as expected. Tests can be written using PHPUnit, which is a popular testing framework for PHP.

## Example code

```
<?php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class MyTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testSomething()
    {
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

## Output example

```
OK (1 test, 1 assertion)
```

The code above is a basic example of a test written in PHPUnit. The `assertTrue()` method is used to check that the given expression is true.

To learn more about writing tests in Symfony with PHP, you can refer to the [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html) and the [PHPUnit documentation](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
