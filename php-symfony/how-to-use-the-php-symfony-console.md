# How to use the PHP Symfony console?
// plain

The Symfony Console is a powerful command line interface for interacting with Symfony applications. It allows you to execute commands, create and manage your Symfony applications, and perform other tasks.

To use the Symfony Console, you must first install the Symfony Console component. This can be done using Composer:

```
composer require symfony/console
```

Once the component is installed, you can use the `bin/console` command to access the Symfony Console. This command takes a command name as its first argument, followed by any additional arguments or options. For example, to list all available commands:

```
bin/console list
```

The Symfony Console also provides a number of helpful options, such as `--help` to display help for a command, and `--quiet` to suppress output.
