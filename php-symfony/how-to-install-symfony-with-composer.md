1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) on your system.
2. Create a new project with the following command:
```
composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton my-project
```
3. This will create a new directory called `my-project` with the latest version of Symfony installed.
4. You can then start the built-in web server with the following command:
```
cd my-project
php bin/console server:run
```
5. You can now access your Symfony application at `http://localhost:8000`.
