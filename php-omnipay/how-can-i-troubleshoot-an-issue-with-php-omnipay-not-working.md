// plain

1. Check your Omnipay setup and configuration. Make sure the gateway is properly configured and that the parameters you are passing are valid.

2. Check your server environment. Make sure the PHP version is compatible with your Omnipay version, and that any required extensions are installed and enabled.

3. Check your code. Make sure you are using the correct namespaces and that the parameters you are passing to the gateway are valid.

4. Check your logs. Look for any errors or warnings that may be related to your issue.

5. Debug your code. Add `var_dump()` statements to your code to see what data is being passed to the gateway.

6. Test your code. Try running the code in a test environment to see if the issue is environment-specific.

7. Search for solutions. Check the [Omnipay documentation](https://omnipay.thephpleague.com/), forums, and other resources for solutions to similar issues.
