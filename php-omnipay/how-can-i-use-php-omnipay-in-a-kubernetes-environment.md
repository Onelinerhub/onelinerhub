# How can I use PHP Omnipay in a Kubernetes environment?
// plain

PHP Omnipay is a payment processing library that allows developers to integrate payment gateways into their applications. It can be used in a Kubernetes environment by creating a Docker image that contains the library and its dependencies.

The following example code creates a Docker image with PHP Omnipay installed:
```
FROM php:7.4-apache

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    unzip

# Install PHP Omnipay
RUN git clone https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay.git /var/www/html/omnipay
```

Once the image is built, it can be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. This can be done with a `Deployment` resource, which will create a `Pod` that contains the image and its dependencies.

The following example code creates a `Deployment` resource for the PHP Omnipay image:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: php-omnipay
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: php-omnipay
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: php-omnipay
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-omnipay
        image: php-omnipay
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Once the `Deployment` resource is created, the PHP Omnipay library can be used in the Kubernetes cluster.
