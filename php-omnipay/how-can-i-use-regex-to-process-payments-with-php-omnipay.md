# How can I use Regex to process payments with PHP Omnipay?
// plain

Using Regex to process payments with PHP Omnipay is quite simple. All you need to do is specify the regular expression pattern in the `validate` function of the payment gateway. For example, to validate a credit card number, you can use the following code:

```php
$gateway->validate(array(
    'card_number' => $card_number,
    'pattern' => '/^\d{16}$/'
));
```

This code will validate a 16-digit credit card number. The `$card_number` variable should contain the card number. The `/^\d{16}$/` pattern will match only 16-digit numbers.

You can also use Regex patterns to validate other payment fields, such as expiration date, CVV code, etc. Here is an example of a pattern that validates an expiration date in MM/YY format:

```php
$gateway->validate(array(
    'expiration_date' => $expiration_date,
    'pattern' => '/^(0[1-9]|1[0-2])\/\d{2}$/'
));
```

This code will validate an expiration date in MM/YY format. The `$expiration_date` variable should contain the expiration date. The `/^(0[1-9]|1[0-2])\/\d{2}$/` pattern will match only numbers in MM/YY format.

You can find more information about using Regex with PHP Omnipay in the [official documentation](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay-common/blob/master/src/Message/AbstractRequest.php#L743).
