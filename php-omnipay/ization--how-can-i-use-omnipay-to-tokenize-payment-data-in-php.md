How can I use Omnipay to tokenize payment data in PHP?
// plain

Omnipay is a payment processing library for PHP. It provides an easy way to tokenize payment data in PHP. To use Omnipay to tokenize payment data, you will need to include the Omnipay library in your project.

The following example code shows how to use Omnipay to tokenize payment data:

```php
// Include the Omnipay library
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Create a gateway object
$gateway = Omnipay::create('MyGateway');

// Initialize the gateway
$gateway->initialize(array(
    'apiKey' => 'MyApiKey',
));

// Tokenize the payment data
$response = $gateway->tokenize(array(
    'card' => array(
        'number' => '4111111111111111',
        'expiryMonth' => '10',
        'expiryYear' => '2030',
        'cvv' => '123',
    ),
));

// Get the token
$token = $response->getToken();

echo $token;
```

The output of this code is the token string, which can then be used to make payments.

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. Include the Omnipay library - This is used to include the Omnipay library in your project.
2. Create a gateway object - This is used to create a gateway object to access the payment gateway.
3. Initialize the gateway - This is used to initialize the gateway with the required API key.

5. Get the token - This is used to retrieve the token from the response.
