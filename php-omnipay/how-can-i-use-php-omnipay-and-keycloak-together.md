# How can I use PHP Omnipay and Keycloak together?
// plain

PHP Omnipay and Keycloak can be used together to provide secure authentication and payment processing.

First, you need to install the Omnipay PHP library using Composer:

```
composer require omnipay/omnipay
```

Next, install the Keycloak PHP library:

```
composer require keycloak/keycloak-php
```

Then you can use the Keycloak library to authenticate users and the Omnipay library to process payments.

For example, you can use the following code to authenticate a user and then process a payment:

```
<?php

// Authenticate user
$keycloak = new Keycloak('/path/to/keycloak.json');
$keycloak->authenticate();

// Process payment
$gateway = Omnipay::create('Paypal_Express');
$gateway->setUsername('your_username');
$gateway->setPassword('your_password');
$response = $gateway->purchase(['amount' => '10.00', 'currency' => 'USD'])->send();

if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    echo "Payment was successful!";
} else {
    echo "Payment was not successful. Error message: ".$response->getMessage();
}
```

This code will authenticate the user and then process a payment for $10.00 USD.
