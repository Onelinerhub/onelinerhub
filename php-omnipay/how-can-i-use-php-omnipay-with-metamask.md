# How can I use PHP Omnipay with MetaMask?
// plain

PHP Omnipay is a payment processing library for PHP. It can be used to integrate payments with MetaMask, a browser extension for Ethereum-based transactions.

To use PHP Omnipay with MetaMask, you will need to install the Omnipay library and set up a payment gateway.

1. Install the Omnipay library:

```
composer require omnipay/omnipay
```

2. Set up a payment gateway:

```php
$gateway = Omnipay::create('Metamask');
$gateway->setClientId('your-client-id');
$gateway->setClientSecret('your-client-secret');
```

3. Create a payment request:

```php
$params = [
    'amount' => 10.00,
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'returnUrl' => 'https://example.com/return',
];

$response = $gateway->purchase($params)->send();
```

4. Generate a MetaMask payment request:

```php
$paymentRequest = $response->getPaymentRequest();
```

5. Display the MetaMask payment request to the user:

```php
echo $paymentRequest;
```

The user can then use MetaMask to complete the payment.
