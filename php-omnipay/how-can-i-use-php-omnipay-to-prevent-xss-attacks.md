# How can I use PHP Omnipay to prevent XSS attacks?
// plain

To prevent XSS attacks when using PHP Omnipay, you can use the `htmlspecialchars()` method. This method takes a string as an argument and returns a string with special characters converted to HTML entities. For example, `<script>` would be converted to `&lt;script&gt;`, which is safe to display in a browser.

## Example code

```php
$unsafeString = '<script>alert("XSS Attack!");</script>';
$safeString = htmlspecialchars($unsafeString);
echo $safeString;
```
## Output example

```
&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS Attack!");&lt;/script&gt;
```

The code above will take an unsafe string and convert it to a safe string by using the `htmlspecialchars()` method. This will prevent XSS attacks when using PHP Omnipay.

## Code explanation

- `$unsafeString`: This variable holds the string that is unsafe and can cause an XSS attack.
- `$safeString`: This variable holds the string that is safe and won't cause an XSS attack.
- `htmlspecialchars()`: This method takes a string as an argument and returns a string with special characters converted to HTML entities.
