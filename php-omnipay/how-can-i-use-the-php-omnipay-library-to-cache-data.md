# How can I use the PHP Omnipay library to cache data?
// plain

The PHP Omnipay library can be used to cache data by using the `cache()` method. This method stores the data in a cache file, so that it can be retrieved quickly when needed. The following example shows how to cache a string of data:

```
<?php
$data = 'My cached data';
$omnipay = new Omnipay();
$omnipay->cache($data);
```

The `cache()` method takes two arguments, the data to be cached and an optional expiration time. The expiration time is specified in seconds and defaults to one hour.

The `cache()` method returns a string containing the name of the cached file. This can be used to retrieve the cached data at a later time. The following example shows how to retrieve the cached data:

```
<?php
$omnipay = new Omnipay();
$cachedData = $omnipay->cache($cachedFile);
echo $cachedData;
// Outputs: My cached data
```

The `cache()` method also provides a way to delete the cached data. This is done by passing the `true` boolean as the third argument to the `cache()` method.

```
<?php
$omnipay = new Omnipay();
$omnipay->cache($cachedFile, null, true);
```
