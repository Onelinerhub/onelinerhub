# How can I use PHP Omnipay to make HTTP requests?
// plain

PHP Omnipay is a payment processing library for PHP that provides an easy way to make HTTP requests. It supports many payment gateways and can be used to process payments in a variety of ways.

To make an HTTP request with PHP Omnipay, you need to include the Omnipay library in your project and create an instance of the Omnipay\Common\Http\Client class. You can then use the `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, and `delete()` methods to make HTTP requests.

For example, here is how you would make a GET request with PHP Omnipay:

```php
$client = new \Omnipay\Common\Http\Client();
$response = $client->get('http://example.com/api/v1/users');

if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    echo $response->getBody();
}
```

The `get()` method takes a URL as its first argument and an array of parameters as its second argument. The response is an instance of `\Omnipay\Common\Http\Response`, which has methods for checking the status code and retrieving the response body.

In addition to making HTTP requests, PHP Omnipay also provides methods for creating and signing requests for various payment gateways.
