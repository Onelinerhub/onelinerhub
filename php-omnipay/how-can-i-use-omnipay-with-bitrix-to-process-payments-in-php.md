# How can I use Omnipay with Bitrix to process payments in PHP?
// plain

Omnipay is a payment processing library for PHP which can be used with Bitrix to process payments.

To use Omnipay with Bitrix, you will need to install the Omnipay library and configure it to work with Bitrix.

The following example code shows how to use Omnipay with Bitrix to process payments:

```php
// Include the Omnipay library
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

// Create an Omnipay gateway
$gateway = Omnipay::create('Bitrix');

// Set the parameters for the payment
$params = [
    'amount' => '10.00',
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'transactionId' => '12345',
    'returnUrl' => 'http://example.com/return',
    'cancelUrl' => 'http://example.com/cancel'
];

// Send the payment request
$response = $gateway->purchase($params)->send();

// Get the response from the payment gateway
if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    // Payment was successful
    echo "Payment successful!\n";
} elseif ($response->isRedirect()) {
    // Redirect to offsite payment gateway
    $response->redirect();
} else {
    // Payment failed
    echo "Payment failed!\n";
}
```

This example code will send a payment request to the Bitrix payment gateway, and if the request is successful, it will output a message saying "Payment successful!". If the payment request is unsuccessful, it will output a message saying "Payment failed!". If the payment request requires a redirect to an offsite payment gateway, the code will redirect the user to the offsite payment gateway.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Include the Omnipay library: This includes the Omnipay library, which is used to create and send the payment request.

2. Create an Omnipay gateway: This creates an Omnipay gateway object, which is used to send the payment request to the Bitrix payment gateway.

3. Set the parameters for the payment: This sets the parameters for the payment, such as the amount, currency, transaction ID, return URL, and cancel URL.

4. Send the payment request: This sends the payment request to the Bitrix payment gateway.

5. Get the response from the payment gateway: This gets the response from the payment gateway, and if the response is successful, it outputs a message saying "Payment successful!", if the response is unsuccessful, it outputs a message saying "Payment failed!", and if the response requires a redirect to an offsite payment gateway, it redirects the user to the offsite payment gateway.
