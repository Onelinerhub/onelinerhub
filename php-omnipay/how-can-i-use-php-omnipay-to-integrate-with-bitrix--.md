# How can I use PHP Omnipay to integrate with Bitrix24?
// plain

PHP Omnipay is a payment processing library that can be used to integrate with Bitrix24. It provides a unified API for working with a variety of payment gateways, including Bitrix24.

To use PHP Omnipay with Bitrix24, you will need to install the Omnipay library and create a Bitrix24 gateway instance.

## Example code


```
// Create a gateway for the Bitrix24 Gateway
// (routes to GatewayFactory::create)
$gateway = Omnipay::create('Bitrix24');

// Initialise the gateway
$gateway->initialize(array(
    'clientId' => 'your_client_id', // Your Bitrix24 Client ID
    'clientSecret' => 'your_client_secret', // Your Bitrix24 Client Secret
    'redirectUri' => 'your_redirect_url', // Your redirect URL
));

// Get the authorization URL
$authorizationUrl = $gateway->getAuthorizeUrl();

// Redirect to the authorization URL
header('Location: ' . $authorizationUrl);
```

This code will create a Bitrix24 gateway instance, and then generate an authorization URL which will be used to redirect the user to the Bitrix24 authorization page.

## Code explanation
