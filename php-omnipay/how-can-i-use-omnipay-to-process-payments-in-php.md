# How can I use Omnipay to process payments in PHP?
// plain

Omnipay is a payment processing library for PHP. It provides a consistent and secure interface for processing payments across a variety of payment gateways. It is a package for the PHP Framework [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

To use Omnipay to process payments in PHP, you need to install the library and configure it for the payment gateway of your choice.

You can install the Omnipay library using Composer:

```bash
composer require omnipay/omnipay
```

Once the library is installed, you need to create an instance of the gateway you want to use:

```php
$gateway = Omnipay::create('PayPal_Express');
$gateway->setUsername('your_username');
$gateway->setPassword('your_password');
```

You can then call the `purchase` method to process the payment:

```php
$response = $gateway->purchase(array(
    'amount' => '10.00',
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'returnUrl' => 'https://www.example.com/return',
    'cancelUrl' => 'https://www.example.com/cancel',
))->send();

if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    // payment was successful: update database
    print_r($response);
} elseif ($response->isRedirect()) {
    // redirect to offsite payment gateway
    $response->redirect();
} else {
    // payment failed: display message to customer
    echo $response->getMessage();
}
```
