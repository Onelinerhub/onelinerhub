# How can I use PHP Omnipay to process financial transactions?
// plain

PHP Omnipay is a framework for processing online payments. It provides a unified interface for different payment gateways and allows developers to easily integrate their applications with multiple payment gateways.

To use PHP Omnipay to process financial transactions, you will need to first install the library and create an instance of the gateway you are using. For example, to use the Stripe gateway:

```php
$gateway = Omnipay::create('Stripe');
$gateway->setApiKey('your_api_key');
```

Once the gateway is set up, you can start processing payments. For example, to charge a credit card:

```php
$response = $gateway->purchase([
    'amount' => '10.00',
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'card' => [
        'number' => '4111111111111111',
        'expiryMonth' => '12',
        'expiryYear' => '2030',
        'cvv' => '123'
    ]
])->send();

if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    echo "Payment successful!\n";
    echo "Transaction reference: " . $response->getTransactionReference() . "\n";
} else {
    echo "Payment failed: " . $response->getMessage() . "\n";
}
```

The code above will attempt to charge a credit card with the specified amount and currency, and will print out a message to indicate whether the payment was successful.
