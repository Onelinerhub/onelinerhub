# How can I use PHP Omnipay to transform data?
// plain

PHP Omnipay is a payment processing library for PHP. It can be used to transform data by providing a simple interface to a variety of payment gateways.

For example, to process a credit card payment, you can use the following code:
```
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$gateway = Omnipay::create('PayPal_Express');
$gateway->setUsername('your_username');
$gateway->setPassword('your_password');

$params = [
    'amount' => '10.00',
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'card' => [
        'firstName' => 'John',
        'lastName' => 'Doe',
        'number' => '4111111111111111',
        'expiryMonth' => '01',
        'expiryYear' => '2021',
        'cvv' => '123',
    ],
];

$response = $gateway->purchase($params)->send();

if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    echo "Payment successful!\n";
} else {
    echo "Payment failed!\n";
}

```

The code above is used to process a credit card payment using the PayPal Express gateway. It sets up the gateway object with the username and password, and passes in the data for the purchase. The response object is then used to determine whether the payment was successful or not.

The parts of the code above are:

- `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'` - This loads the Omnipay library.
- `$gateway = Omnipay::create('PayPal_Express')` - This creates the gateway object for PayPal Express.
- `$gateway->setUsername('your_username')` - This sets the username for the gateway.
- `$gateway->setPassword('your_password')` - This sets the password for the gateway.
- `$params` - This is an array containing the data for the purchase.
- `$response = $gateway->purchase($params)->send()` - This sends the purchase request to the gateway.
- `if ($response->isSuccessful())` - This checks the response to see if the payment was successful.
