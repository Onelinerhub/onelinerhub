# How can I use Kaspersky with PHP Omnipay?
// plain

Kaspersky can be used with PHP Omnipay to provide secure online payments. To do this, you will need to use the Kaspersky Payment Gateway API. This API allows you to integrate Kaspersky with your PHP Omnipay application.

The following example code shows how to use the Kaspersky Payment Gateway API with PHP Omnipay to make an online payment:

```php
// Include the Omnipay library
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

// Create an Omnipay gateway instance
$gateway = Omnipay::create('Kaspersky');

// Set the parameters for the payment
$params = [
    'amount' => 10.00,
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'transactionId' => '12345',
    'description' => 'Test Payment',
    'returnUrl' => 'https://example.com/return',
    'cancelUrl' => 'https://example.com/cancel',
];

// Send the payment request
$response = $gateway->purchase($params)->send();

// Check if the payment was successful
if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    // Payment was successful
    echo 'Payment successful!';
} else {
    // Payment failed
    echo 'Payment failed: ' . $response->getMessage();
}
```

This code will send an online payment request using the Kaspersky Payment Gateway API. If the payment is successful, it will output the message "Payment successful!"; otherwise, it will output an error message.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `require_once('vendor/autoload.php')`: This includes the Omnipay library, which is needed for the payment request.
2. `$gateway = Omnipay::create('Kaspersky')`: This creates an Omnipay gateway instance for the Kaspersky Payment Gateway API.
3. `$params`: This sets the parameters for the payment request.
4. `$response = $gateway->purchase($params)->send()`: This sends the payment request.
5. `if ($response->isSuccessful())`: This checks if the payment was successful.
