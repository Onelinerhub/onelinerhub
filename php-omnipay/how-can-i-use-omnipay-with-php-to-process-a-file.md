# How can I use Omnipay with PHP to process a file?
// plain

Omnipay is a PHP library that provides an abstracted interface for processing payments. It can be used to process a file by first setting up the gateway and then by calling the `purchase` method.

```php
// Create a gateway for the PayPal Express Checkout
// (routes to GatewayFactory::create)
$gateway = Omnipay::create('PayPal_Express');

// Initialise the gateway
$gateway->initialize(array(
    'username' => 'example',
    'password' => 'secret',
    'signature' => 'signature',
    'testMode' => true, // Or false when you are ready for live transactions
));

// Do an authorize transaction on the gateway
$transaction = $gateway->purchase(array(
    'amount' => '10.00',
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'file' => 'path/to/file.txt',
));

// Process the file
$response = $transaction->send();

if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    // The file was processed successfully
    echo "File processed successfully!\n";
} else {
    // There was an error
    echo "File processing failed!\n";
}
```

## Output example

```
File processed successfully!
```

The code above sets up a gateway for PayPal Express Checkout and then calls the `purchase` method with the `amount`, `currency` and `file` parameters. The `file` parameter is the path to the file that needs to be processed. The `send` method is then called which processes the file and returns a response. The response is then checked to see if it was successful or not.
