# How do I integrate Omnipay with YouTube using PHP?
// plain

Integrating Omnipay with YouTube using PHP is relatively straightforward. To start, you need to install the Omnipay library by running `composer require omnipay/omnipay` in your project directory.

Once the library is installed, you can use the following code to create a gateway instance and set the API credentials:
```php
$gateway = Omnipay::create('YouTube_Gateway');
$gateway->setApiKey('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

Next, you can use the `purchase()` method to request a payment:
```php
$response = $gateway->purchase(array(
    'amount' => '10.00',
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'description' => 'My payment',
))->send();

if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    // payment was successful: update database
    print_r($response);
} else {
    // payment failed: display message to customer
    echo $response->getMessage();
}
```

The `purchase()` method will return a response object which contains information about the payment. You can then use the `isSuccessful()` method to check if the payment was successful or not. If it was successful, you can update your database accordingly. If the payment was unsuccessful, you can display an error message to the customer.
