How can I use PHP Omnipay to process payments?
// plain

PHP Omnipay is a payment processing library for PHP which can be used to process payments. It provides an object-oriented interface for processing payments with various payment gateways.

To use PHP Omnipay to process payments, first install the library via composer:

```
composer require league/omnipay
```

Then, create an Omnipay gateway object, passing it your payment gateway credentials:

```php
$gateway = Omnipay::create('PayPal_Express');
$gateway->setUsername('YOUR_PAYPAL_USERNAME');
$gateway->setPassword('YOUR_PAYPAL_PASSWORD');
```

Next, create a payment request using the gateway object, and set the payment parameters such as the amount and currency:

```php
$request = $gateway->purchase(array(
    'amount' => '10.00',
    'currency' => 'USD',
));
```

Finally, send the request to the payment gateway, and handle the response:

```php
$response = $request->send();
if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
    // Payment was successful
    echo "Payment was successful!\n";
} else {
    // Payment failed
    echo "Payment failed!\n";
}
```
