# How can I use PHP Omnipay to find a job?
// plain

Unfortunately, PHP Omnipay cannot be used to find a job. However, it can be used to facilitate online payments for goods and services.

For example, the following code can be used to set up a payment gateway using the PayPal driver:

```
use Omnipay\Omnipay;

$gateway = Omnipay::create('PayPal_Express');
$gateway->setUsername('my-paypal-username');
$gateway->setPassword('my-paypal-password');
$gateway->setSignature('my-paypal-signature');
```

The code above sets up the payment gateway using the PayPal driver and passes the username, password and signature for authentication.

The following code can be used to initiate a payment:

```
// Set parameters
$parameters = [
    'amount' => 10.00,
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'returnUrl' => 'https://www.example.com/return',
    'cancelUrl' => 'https://www.example.com/cancel',
];

// Initiate the purchase
$response = $gateway->purchase($parameters)->send();
```

The code above sets the parameters for the payment including the amount, currency, return and cancel URLs. It then initiates the payment using the `purchase()` method.

The following code can be used to complete the payment:

```
// Get the purchase response
$purchaseResponse = $response->getPurchaseResponse();

// Complete the purchase
$completeResponse = $gateway->completePurchase($purchaseResponse)->send();
```

The code above gets the purchase response and then completes the purchase using the `completePurchase()` method.
