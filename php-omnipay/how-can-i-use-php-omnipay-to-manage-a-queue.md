# How can I use PHP Omnipay to manage a queue?
// plain

PHP Omnipay is a library that makes it easy to integrate payment processing into PHP applications. It can be used to manage a queue by taking advantage of its built-in queueing system. The queueing system allows you to store and process payments in a queue, which can be processed in batches. This is useful for managing large amounts of payments, such as subscriptions or recurring payments.

## Example


```php
// Create a new queue
$queue = Omnipay::queue();

// Add a payment to the queue
$payment = Omnipay::payment($data);
$queue->addPayment($payment);

// Process the queue
$result = $queue->process();

// Check the results
if ($result->isSuccessful()) {
    echo "Payment processed successfully!";
} else {
    echo "Payment failed: " . $result->getErrorMessage();
}
```

The code above creates a new queue, adds a payment to the queue, and then processes the queue. If the payment is successful, the code prints out a success message. If the payment fails, the code prints out an error message.

The code consists of the following parts:

1. Creating a new queue: `$queue = Omnipay::queue();`
2. Adding a payment to the queue: `$payment = Omnipay::payment($data); $queue->addPayment($payment);`
3. Processing the queue: `$result = $queue->process();`
4. Checking the results: `if ($result->isSuccessful()) { ... } else { ... }`
