# How can I use Sphinx Search to manage my team of workers?
// plain

Sphinx Search is a powerful search engine that can be used to manage a team of workers. It allows you to quickly search through large amounts of data and find the information you need.

For example, you can use Sphinx Search to quickly find the names of workers who have a certain skill set or who have worked on a particular project.

To use Sphinx Search, you need to create an index of the data you want to search. This can be done with the `indexer` command. For example, the following command will create an index of the data in the `workers.csv` file:

```
indexer --config workers.conf workers
```

Once the index is created, you can use the `search` command to search the data. For example, the following command will search for workers who have the skill "JavaScript":

```
search --config workers.conf --index workers "skills:JavaScript"
```

The output of this command will be a list of workers who have the skill "JavaScript".

In addition to searching for workers, Sphinx Search can also be used to sort and filter the data. For example, the following command will sort the data by the "name" field:

```
search --config workers.conf --index workers --sort-by name
```

Sphinx Search can be used to quickly and easily search, sort, and filter data to manage a team of workers.
