# How can I use Sphinx Search to weigh my search results?
// plain

Sphinx Search is a powerful full-text search engine that can be used to weight search results. It supports a range of features, including relevance-based ranking, to help you get the most accurate and relevant search results.

To use Sphinx Search to weight search results, you need to set up a Sphinx configuration file that includes weighting parameters. The following example code shows a basic configuration file with two weighting parameters:

```
index my_index
{
    type = plain
    source = src1
    path = /usr/local/sphinx/data/my_index
    docinfo = extern
    mlock = 0
    morphology = stem_en
    min_word_len = 1
    min_prefix_len = 0
    min_infix_len = 0
    charset_type = utf-8
    charset_table = 0..9, A..Z->a..z, _, a..z, U+410..U+42F->U+430..U+44F, U+430..U+44F
    ignore_chars = U+00AD
    html_strip = 1
    html_index_attrs = img=alt,title; a=title;
    html_remove_elements = style, script
    index_exact_words = 1
    index_sp = 1
    expand_keywords = 1
    weight = name^2
    weight = content
}
```

In this example, the `name` field will be given twice the weight of the `content` field when Sphinx Search is used to weight search results. This means that matches in the `name` field will be more relevant than matches in the `content` field.

You can also use other weighting parameters, such as `field_weights` and `index_field_lengths`, to further refine your search results. For more information, please refer to the [Sphinx Search documentation](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html).
