# How do I use Sphinxsearch with Zsh?
// plain

Sphinxsearch is a full-text search engine that can be used with Zsh. It is an open source search engine written in C++ which can be used to search large amounts of data quickly.

To use Sphinxsearch with Zsh, you will need to install the Sphinxsearch package. On most Linux distributions, you can do this with the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install sphinxsearch
```

Once the package is installed, you can run the Sphinxsearch daemon with the following command:

```
searchd --config /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf
```

This will start the Sphinxsearch daemon and allow you to use the Sphinxsearch API to search for data. To use the Sphinxsearch API, you will need to write a program in Zsh which will make use of the API. This program will need to make use of the Sphinxsearch client library as well as the Sphinxsearch API.

Once you have written the program, you can run it with the following command:

```
zsh my_program.zsh
```

This will run the program and allow you to search for data using the Sphinxsearch API.
