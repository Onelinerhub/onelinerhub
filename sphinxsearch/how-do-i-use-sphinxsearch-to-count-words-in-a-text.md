# How do I use SphinxSearch to count words in a text?
// plain

SphinxSearch is an open-source full-text search engine that can be used to count words in a text. To do this, you need to install SphinxSearch and create an index of the text. After that, you can use the SphinxQL query language to count the words.

For example, you can use the following code to count the words in a text:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM index WHERE MATCH('@text <word>')
```

This will return the total number of words in the text.

## Code explanation


1. `SELECT COUNT(*)`: This is a SQL command that returns the total number of rows in the result set.

2. `FROM index`: This specifies the index that we are querying.

3. `WHERE MATCH('@text <word>')`: This is a full-text search query that searches for the specified word in the text.
