# How do I use Sphinx search fields in my software development project?
// plain

Sphinx Search is a powerful search engine that can be used in software development projects. It is fast, reliable and offers a wide range of features. To use Sphinx Search in a project, you need to first install the Sphinx Search library. After that, you can use the following code to create a Sphinx Search field:

```
$sphinx = new SphinxClient();
$sphinx->setServer("localhost", 9312);
$sphinx->SetMatchMode(SPH_MATCH_EXTENDED2);
$sphinx->SetArrayResult(true);
```

The code above will create a Sphinx Search field and set the server connection parameters. The `setServer` method sets the server and port number, while the `SetMatchMode` method sets the type of search query to use. The `SetArrayResult` method sets the output format to an array.

Once the Sphinx Search field is created, you can use it to query the database. For example, the following code can be used to search for documents that contain the word "software":

```
$result = $sphinx->query("software");
$matches = $result["matches"];
```

The `query` method will search the database for the given term and the `matches` array will contain the results.

To learn more about Sphinx Search, you can refer to the [official documentation](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html).

In summary, Sphinx Search can be used in software development projects to quickly and reliably search databases. To use Sphinx Search, you need to install the library, create a Sphinx Search field, and use the `query` method to search the database.
