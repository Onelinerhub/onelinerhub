# How do I configure the Sphinx search engine to use a custom binlog_path?
// plain

The Sphinx search engine can be configured to use a custom binlog_path by making the following changes to the sphinx.conf configuration file:

1. Add the following line to the `source` section:
```
binlog_path = /path/to/custom/binlog
```
This specifies the path to the custom binlog file.

2. Add the following line to the `index` section:
```
binlog_path = /path/to/custom/binlog
```
This specifies the path to the custom binlog file.

3. Restart the Sphinx server to apply the changes:
```
$ indexer --all
```

4. Verify that the configuration is working by running the following command:
```
$ searchd --config sphinx.conf --status
```

This will output the status of the Sphinx server, including the configured binlog_path.

For more information, please refer to the [Sphinx documentation](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html).
