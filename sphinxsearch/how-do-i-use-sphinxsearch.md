# How do I use SphinxSearch?
// plain

SphinxSearch is an open source full-text search engine written in C++. It's designed to provide fast and relevant full-text search functionality to client applications.

Below is an example of how to use SphinxSearch:

```
# Install SphinxSearch
sudo apt-get install sphinxsearch

# Create a configuration file
sudo vim /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf

# Start the SphinxSearch engine
sudo searchd
```

The configuration file consists of several parts:

1. **indexer** - Defines the data source and the type of index to be created.
2. **source** - Defines the data source to be indexed.
3. **index** - Defines the type of index to be created.
4. **searchd** - Defines the server settings for the search engine.

Once the configuration file is setup, you can start the searchd daemon to start the search engine. The search engine can then be used to search the data source using the SphinxQL query language.

For more information about using SphinxSearch, please refer to the [official documentation](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/).
