# How do I use the Sphinx search engine tutorial?
// plain

The Sphinx search engine tutorial is a great way to learn how to use the search engine. To use it, you need to download the Sphinx source code, compile it, and then install it. Here's an example of how to do this:

```
$ wget http://sphinxsearch.com/files/sphinx-2.2.10-release.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf sphinx-2.2.10-release.tar.gz
$ cd sphinx-2.2.10-release
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

Once Sphinx is installed, you can start using it. To get started, you can use the SphinxQL command line client to connect to the server and execute queries. Here's an example of how to do this:

```
$ mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P9306
```

Once connected, you can start running queries like this:

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM index_name WHERE MATCH('search_term');
```

You can also use the Sphinx API to connect to the server and execute queries. For more information on how to use the Sphinx search engine tutorial, please refer to the following links:
