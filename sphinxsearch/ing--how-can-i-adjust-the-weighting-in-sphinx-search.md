How can I adjust the weighting in Sphinx search?
// plain

The weighting in Sphinx search can be adjusted by using the `WEIGHT()` function. This function allows you to assign weights to specific fields in the query. For example, if you wanted to assign a higher weight to the ‘name’ field than to the ‘description’ field, you could use the following code:

```
SELECT *, WEIGHT(name, 10) AS weight_name, WEIGHT(description, 5) AS weight_description FROM index WHERE MATCH('some query')
```

The output of this query would be a set of results with a weight_name and weight_description field for each result. The weight_name field would contain a higher value than the weight_description field, since it was given a higher weight in the query.

You can also adjust the weighting of specific words in the query. For example, if you wanted to assign a higher weight to the word ‘apple’ than to the word ‘orange’, you could use the following code:

```
SELECT *, WEIGHT(apple, 10) AS weight_apple, WEIGHT(orange, 5) AS weight_orange FROM index WHERE MATCH('apple orange')
```

The output of this query would be a set of results with a weight_apple and weight_orange field for each result. The weight_apple field would contain a higher value than the weight_orange field, since it was given a higher weight in the query.

The following are the main parts of the code used to adjust weighting in Sphinx search:

- `WEIGHT()` function: This function allows you to assign weights to specific fields or words in the query.
- `MATCH()` clause: This clause is used to specify the query that will be used to search the index.

You can find more information on adjusting weighting in Sphinx search in the [Sphinx documentation](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html#weighting).
