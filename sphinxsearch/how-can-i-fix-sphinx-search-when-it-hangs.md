// plain

To fix Sphinx Search when it hangs, you will need to take the following steps:

1. Check the log files for errors. This can be done by running the following command:
```
tail -f /var/log/sphinxsearch/searchd.log
```
This should provide some insight into what is causing the hang.

2. Check the configuration file for any incorrect settings. You can do this by running the following command:
```
cat /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf
```

3. If the configuration file is correct, you may need to restart the Sphinx Search daemon. This can be done by running the following command:
```
sudo service sphinxsearch restart
```

4. If the problem persists, you may need to rebuild the search index. This can be done by running the following command:
```
indexer --all
```

5. If the problem still persists, you may need to update the Sphinx Search version.

6. If the problem still persists, you may need to contact your hosting provider for assistance.
