# How can I use Sphinx Search to query a MySQL database?
// plain

Sphinx Search is an open-source, full-text search engine that can be used to query MySQL databases. It is designed to provide fast and accurate results, and is optimized for large databases.

To use Sphinx Search to query a MySQL database, you must first install and configure the Sphinx Search software. You can then use the SphinxQL query language to issue queries against the database.

For example, the following code can be used to query a MySQL database using Sphinx Search:

```
# Connect to the Sphinx daemon
$client = new SphinxClient();
$client->setServer('localhost', 9312);

# Execute the query
$result = $client->query('SELECT * FROM my_index WHERE MATCH('my_query')');

# Print the results
print_r($result);
```

The output of this code will be an array containing the results of the query.

The code above consists of the following parts:

1. Connecting to the Sphinx daemon: This establishes a connection to the Sphinx Search server.
2. Executing the query: This uses the SphinxQL query language to issue the query against the database.
3. Printing the results: This prints the results of the query as an array.
