// plain

Sphinx Search is a full-text search engine that can be used to create a tutorial. To use Sphinx Search, you need to install the Sphinx package and configure it. Here is an example of how to do this:

```
$ sudo apt-get install sphinxsearch
$ sudo vi /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf
```

The `sphinx.conf` file contains all of the configuration options for Sphinx Search. You can use the configuration options to customize the search engine to your specific needs. After you have configured the search engine, you can start creating your tutorial.

1. Create a text file containing the content for your tutorial.
2. Index the text file using the `indexer` command.
3. Use the `search` command to query the indexed content.
4. Create a web page that displays the search results.

For more information, please refer to the [Sphinx Search documentation](https://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html).
