# How do I use the SphinxSearch API?
// plain

The SphinxSearch API is a powerful tool for searching and indexing text content. It can be used to quickly search through large amounts of text data and return results in a fraction of the time it would take to search through the same data manually.

Using the SphinxSearch API is relatively straightforward. Here is an example of how to use the API to search for a specific term:

```
import sphinxapi

# Create a SphinxClient object
client = sphinxapi.SphinxClient()

# Set the index to search
client.SetIndex('myIndex')

# Set the search query
client.SetQuery('search term')

# Execute the search query
results = client.RunQueries()
```

This code will search the index `myIndex` for the term `search term`. The results of the search will be stored in the `results` variable.

The SphinxSearch API has many other features and options that can be used to customize the search. For more information on the API, please refer to the [SphinxSearch documentation](https://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html).
