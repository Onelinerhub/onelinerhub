1. Installation: SphinxSearch can be installed using the `sphinx-install` command.
2. Configuration: Once installed, SphinxSearch needs to be configured using the `sphinx.conf` file.
3. Indexing: Documents can be indexed using the `indexer` command.
4. Searching: Searches can be performed using the `search` command.
