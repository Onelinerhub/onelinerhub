How do I use SphinxSearch to create a faceted search?
// plain

SphinxSearch is a powerful, open source full-text search engine. It can be used to create a faceted search, which is a type of search that allows users to filter search results by multiple criteria.

To use SphinxSearch to create a faceted search, you need to create a Sphinx configuration file. This configuration file should include the index settings, the source settings, and the query settings. The query settings section is where you will define your facets. For example:

```
query_settings {
    facet {
        type = multi
        attributes = category, color
    }
}
```

This will create two facets, one for the `category` attribute and one for the `color` attribute. These facets will be available to the user when they perform a search, allowing them to filter the results by category and color.

In addition, you will also need to modify your search query to include the facets. This can be done by adding the `OPTION` keyword and the `facet` option to the query. For example:

```
SELECT * FROM index WHERE MATCH('query') OPTION facet=1;
```

This will return the search results with the facets applied.
