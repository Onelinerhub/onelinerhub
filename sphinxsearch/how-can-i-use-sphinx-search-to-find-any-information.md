# How can I use Sphinx Search to find any information?
// plain

Sphinx Search is a powerful open-source full-text search engine that can be used to quickly and easily search for information. It is written in C++ and provides fast and accurate search results.

To use Sphinx Search, you first need to create an index of the data that you want to search. This can be done using the `indexer` command. For example, to create an index for a table called "articles" in a MySQL database, you can use the following command:

```
indexer --config sphinx.conf articles
```

Once the index is created, you can use the `search` command to perform a search. For example, to search for all articles containing the word "Sphinx", you can use the following command:

```
search --config sphinx.conf Sphinx
```

The output of this command will be a list of documents that contain the word "Sphinx".

You can also use Sphinx Search to perform more complex searches, such as searching for documents that contain multiple words, or searching within a certain date range.
