// plain

To find the version of Sphinx Search you're using, you can use the command line interface.

```
$ search --version
```

The output of this command will include the version of Sphinx Search you're using. For example, the output might look like this:

```
Sphinx 2.2.11-release (r5654)
Copyright (c) 2001-2018, Andrew Aksyonoff
Copyright (c) 2008-2016, Sphinx Technologies Inc (http://sphinxsearch.com)
```

You can also find the version of Sphinx Search you're using by looking at the `sphinx.conf` file. This file should be located in the same directory as the Sphinx binary. The version is typically listed at the top of the file.

If you're using SphinxSearch within a web application, you can also check the version by looking at the `sphinxapi.php` file, which should be located in the same directory as the web application. The version is usually listed at the top of the file.
