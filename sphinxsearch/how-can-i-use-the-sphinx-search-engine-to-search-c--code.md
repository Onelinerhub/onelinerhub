# How can I use the Sphinx search engine to search C# code?
// plain

Sphinx is a powerful search engine that can be used to index and search C# code. To use Sphinx to search C# code, you need to first create an index of your C# code. This can be done using the [Sphinx indexer](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/manual-2.2.2.html#indexer) command.

For example, to create an index of all the C# files in the `src` directory, you can use the following command:
```
indexer --config /path/to/sphinx.conf src
```

Once the index is created, you can use the [Sphinx searchd](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/manual-2.2.2.html#searchd) command to search the indexed C# files. For example, to search for the word "string" in the `src` index, you can use the following command:
```
searchd --config /path/to/sphinx.conf --query string
```

This will output the search results, such as the file path, line number, and the line containing the search term.

The following are the parts of the example code:
- `indexer`: The Sphinx indexer command which is used to create an index of the C# files.
- `--config`: The command line argument used to specify the path to the Sphinx configuration file.
- `src`: The directory containing the C# files to be indexed.
- `searchd`: The Sphinx searchd command which is used to search the indexed C# files.
- `--query`: The command line argument used to specify the search term.
