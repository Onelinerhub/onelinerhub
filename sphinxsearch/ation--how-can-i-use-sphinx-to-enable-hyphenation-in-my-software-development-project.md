How can I use Sphinx to enable hyphenation in my software development project?
// plain

**Sphinx** is a powerful documentation generator for Python projects. It can be used to enable hyphenation in software development projects.

To use Sphinx for hyphenation, you need to add the `\hyphenation{<word>}` command to the preamble of your project. Here's an example:

```
\hyphenation{hyphen-ation}
```

This command tells Sphinx to hyphenate the word "hyphenation" when it is encountered in the text.

You can also specify multiple words to be hyphenated, separated by spaces:

```
\hyphenation{hyphen-ation soft-ware devel-op-ment}
```

In addition, you can specify a language to be used for hyphenation by adding the `\usepackage[<language>]{babel}` command to the preamble of your project. Here's an example:

```
\usepackage[english]{babel}
```

This command tells Sphinx to use the English language for hyphenation.
