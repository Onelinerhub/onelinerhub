# How do I access and use the SphinxSearch source code?
// plain

1. To access and use the SphinxSearch source code, you need to clone the project from GitHub. You can do this by running the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sphinxsearch/sphinx.git
```
2. Once the project has been cloned, you can then compile the source code by running the following commands:
```
$ cd sphinx
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```
3. After the source code has been compiled, you can then use the SphinxSearch API to interact with the search engine. The API consists of the following parts:
* SphinxClient - This is the main class used for interacting with the search engine. It provides methods for connecting to the server, sending queries, and retrieving results.
* SphinxQL - This is a SQL-like query language that can be used to query the search engine.
* SphinxUtil - This is a utility class that provides various helper methods for dealing with SphinxSearch.
4. You can find detailed documentation on how to use the API [here](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html).
5. You can also find examples of how to use the API [here](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current/examples.html).
6. Additionally, you can find a collection of sample applications written in various languages [here](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current/sample-apps.html).
