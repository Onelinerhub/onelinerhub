# How do I configure SphinxSearch to ignore certain stop words?
// plain

In order to configure SphinxSearch to ignore certain stop words, you must first define the stop words in a text file. This text file must be located in the `data/` directory of the SphinxSearch installation.

For example, if your stop words are `the`, `a`, and `an`, you can create a text file called `stopwords.txt` with the following content:
```
the
a
an
```

Then, you must add the following line to the SphinxSearch configuration file (`sphinx.conf`):
```
stopwords = data/stopwords.txt
```

Once the configuration is complete, you must restart the SphinxSearch daemon for the changes to take effect.

The following parts are involved in configuring SphinxSearch to ignore certain stop words:

1. Create a text file containing the stop words to be ignored.
2. Place the text file in the `data/` directory of the SphinxSearch installation.
3. Add the `stopwords` directive to the SphinxSearch configuration file.
4. Restart the SphinxSearch daemon.
