To implement Sphinx search in a Laravel application, the following steps should be followed:

1. Install the Laravel-Sphinx package using Composer:
```
composer require jbzoo/sphinx
```

2. Add the following line to the `config/app.php` file:
```
'Jbzoo\Sphinx\SphinxServiceProvider'
```

3. Run the following command to publish the configuration file:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Jbzoo\Sphinx\SphinxServiceProvider"
```

4. Configure the `config/sphinxsearch.php` file to match your Sphinx installation.

5. Create a new Eloquent model that extends the `Jbzoo\Sphinx\Model\Sphinx` model.
