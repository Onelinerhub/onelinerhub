# How can I fix Sphinx search when it is not working?
// plain

1. First, check your Sphinx configuration file (`sphinx.conf`) for any errors. To do this, run `indexer --all --config <path_to_sphinx.conf> --verbose` and look for errors in the output.

2. If there are errors in the configuration file, make sure to fix them before continuing.

3. Once the configuration file is valid, you can start the Sphinx search daemon by running `searchd --config <path_to_sphinx.conf>`.

4. After the search daemon is running, you can test if Sphinx search is working by running `search --config <path_to_sphinx.conf> <query>`. This should output the search results for the given query.

5. If Sphinx search is still not working, try rebuilding the indexes by running `indexer --all --config <path_to_sphinx.conf>`.

6. If the problem persists, make sure to check the Sphinx log file (`searchd.log`) for any errors.

7. If all else fails, you may need to consult the [Sphinx documentation](http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html) for further troubleshooting.
