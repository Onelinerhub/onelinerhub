# How can I use Sphinx to search for words in a specific form?
// plain

Sphinx is a powerful full-text search engine that can be used to search for words in a specific form. It is written in C++ and can be used as a stand-alone search engine or as a plug-in for other applications.

To use Sphinx to search for words in a specific form, you will need to create an index of the data you want to search. This index will contain the words and their forms. Once this index is created, you can use the SphinxQL query language to search the index for words in a specific form.

For example, you can use the following code to search for words in the form of a verb:

```
SELECT *
FROM index
WHERE MATCH('@wordform verb')
```

This query will search the index for words in the form of a verb and return the results.

The following list explains the parts of the code:
- `SELECT *` - This part of the query will return all of the fields from the index.
- `FROM index` - This part of the query specifies the index to search.
- `WHERE MATCH('@wordform verb')` - This part of the query specifies the word form to search for. In this case, it is searching for words in the form of a verb.
