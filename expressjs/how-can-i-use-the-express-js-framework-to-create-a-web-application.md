# How can I use the Express.js framework to create a web application?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of web applications. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware, view system, and more.

To create a web application with Express.js, you need to install the framework and set up your project. Here is an example of a simple Express.js application:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

The code above will create a simple web application that will listen on port 3000 and respond with "Hello World!" when a request is made to the root URL.

## Code explanation

1. Requiring the Express.js module `const express = require('express');`
2. Creating an Express.js application instance `const app = express();`
3. Setting up a route to handle requests to the root URL `app.get('/', (req, res) => {...});`
4. Sending a response to the request `res.send('Hello World!');`
5. Starting the server `app.listen(3000, () => {...});`
