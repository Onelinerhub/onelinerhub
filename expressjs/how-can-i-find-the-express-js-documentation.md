The Express.js documentation can be found on the official website.

To access the documentation, visit the following link:

* [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)

The documentation is divided into sections covering the various aspects of Express.js.

For example, the "Routing" section covers topics such as how to define routes, how to create dynamic routes, how to use route parameters, and how to create custom route handlers.

The "Application" section covers topics such as how to configure an application, how to use middleware, and how to use the Express.js router.

The "HTTP" section covers topics such as how to create HTTP requests, how to respond to requests, how to set response headers, and how to send files.

The "Tools" section covers topics such as how to debug Express.js applications, how to test Express.js applications, and how to use the Express.js CLI.

The documentation also includes several code examples to illustrate how to use Express.js.

For example, the following code snippet shows how to create a simple Express.js application:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000!');
});
```

The output of the code snippet is the following:

```
Server listening on port 3000!
```
