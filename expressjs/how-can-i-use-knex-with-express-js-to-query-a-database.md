# How can I use Knex with Express.js to query a database?
// plain

Knex is an SQL query builder for Node.js that can be used with Express.js to query a database. To use Knex with Express, first install the Knex and the appropriate database client library (i.e. pg for PostgreSQL).

```
npm install knex pg
```

Then, create a Knex instance and connect it to the database.

```
const knex = require('knex')({
  client: 'pg',
  connection: {
    host : '127.0.0.1',
    user : 'your_database_user',
    password : 'your_database_password',
    database : 'myapp_test'
  }
});
```

After the connection is established, you can use Knex to query the database. For example, to select all records from a table named `users`, you can use the `knex.select()` method:

```
knex.select().from('users')
  .then(rows => {
    for (row of rows) {
      console.log(`${row['name']} is ${row['age']}`);
    }
  });
```

## Output example

```
John is 25
Jane is 23
```

The `knex.select()` method takes in a list of fields to select, a `where` clause to filter results, and other parameters to customize the query. You can find more information about the `knex.select()` method in the [Knex documentation](http://knexjs.org/#Builder-select).

Once the query is executed, the results can be used in Express routes and views. For example, the results of the query above can be used to render a list of users in an Express view:

```
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  knex.select().from('users')
    .then(rows => {
      res.render('users', { users: rows });
    });
});
```

In summary, Knex can be used with Express.js to query a database. To use Knex, install the Knex and database client libraries, create a Knex instance and connect it to the database, then use the `knex.select()` method to query the database. The results can then be used in Express routes and views.
