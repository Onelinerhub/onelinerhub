# How can I use Express.js and Kafka together to create an application?
// plain

Express.js and Kafka can be used together to create an application by leveraging the capabilities of both frameworks. An example of this is to use Express.js to provide a web-based API interface for an application, while Kafka is used to process the data received from the API.

```
// Create a Kafka consumer
const consumer = new Kafka.KafkaConsumer(options);

// Create an Express.js application
const app = express();

// Set up a route to receive data from the API
app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
    const data = req.body;
    consumer.send(data);
    res.send('Data received');
});

// Start the Express.js application
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('App listening on port 3000'));
```

## Output example
 App listening on port 3000

The code above creates a Kafka consumer, an Express.js application, and sets up a route to receive data from the API. The data received is then sent to the Kafka consumer and a response is sent to the API.

## Code explanation

1. `const consumer = new Kafka.KafkaConsumer(options);` Creates a Kafka consumer.
2. `const app = express();` Creates an Express.js application.
3. `app.post('/data', (req, res) => {...})` Sets up a route to receive data from the API.
4. `consumer.send(data);` Sends the data received from the API to the Kafka consumer.
5. `res.send('Data received');` Sends a response to the API.
6. `app.listen(3000, () => console.log('App listening on port 3000'));` Starts the Express.js application.
