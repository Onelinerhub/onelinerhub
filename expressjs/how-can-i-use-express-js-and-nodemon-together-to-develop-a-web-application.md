# How can I use Express.js and Nodemon together to develop a web application?
// plain

Express.js and Nodemon can be used together to develop a web application.

Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. This makes it easier to develop web applications since you don't have to manually restart the server each time you make a change.

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that allows you to easily create web applications.

To use Express.js and Nodemon together, you can create a Node.js project and install Express.js and Nodemon using the following commands:

```
npm install express --save
npm install nodemon --save-dev
```

Then create an Express.js application by creating a file called `app.js` and adding the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

Finally, start the server using the `nodemon` command:

```
nodemon app.js
```

This will start the server and watch for any changes in the `app.js` file. Whenever a change is detected, the server will automatically restart.
