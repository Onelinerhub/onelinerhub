# How do I use Express.js to patch a route?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It is used to create web applications and APIs. To patch a route with Express.js, you need to use the `app.patch` method. This method takes two parameters: a path and a callback function. The path is the URL of the route you want to patch, and the callback function is the code that will be executed when the route is requested.

## Example


```javascript
app.patch('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // code to patch the user
});
```

This code adds a route for patching a user with the given ID. The `req` object contains the request data, and the `res` object is used to send a response back to the client.

## Code explanation


1. `app.patch` - The method used to create a route for patching.
2. `'/users/:id'` - The URL of the route.
3. `(req, res)` - The parameters passed into the callback function.
4. `// code to patch the user` - The code that will be executed when the route is requested.
