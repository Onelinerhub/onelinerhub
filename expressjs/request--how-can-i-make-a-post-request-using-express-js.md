How can I make a POST request using Express.js?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of creating web applications and APIs. To make a POST request using Express.js, you can use the `app.post()` method. The `app.post()` method takes two parameters: a path and a callback function. The path is the URL that the request is sent to, and the callback function is the code that is executed when the request is received. Here is an example of a POST request using Express.js:

```
app.post('/', function(req, res) {
    // code to handle the request
    res.send('POST request received!');
});
```

## Output example
 `POST request received!`

The code above creates a POST request to the root URL (`/`). When the request is received, the callback function is executed. The `req` parameter is an object that contains information about the request, and the `res` parameter is an object that contains methods for responding to the request. In this example, the `res.send()` method is used to send the response `POST request received!`.

Parts of the code:

- `app.post()`: The method used to create a POST request.
- `'/'`: The path for the request.
- `function(req, res)`: The callback function that is executed when the request is received.
- `req`: An object containing information about the request.
- `res`: An object containing methods for responding to the request.
- `res.send()`: A method used to send a response to the request.
