# How do I find and fix CVEs in an Express.js application?
// plain

To find and fix CVEs in an Express.js application, begin by searching the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for any known vulnerabilities related to the version of Express.js you are using.

Once any known vulnerabilities have been identified, you can then use the `npm audit` command to scan your application for any vulnerable packages that may be used by your Express.js application.

```
npm audit
```

This command will generate a report of any vulnerable packages that need to be updated or patched.

You can then use the `npm audit fix` command to automatically install the latest version of the vulnerable packages.

```
npm audit fix
```

Once the vulnerable packages have been updated, you can then use the `npm audit` command again to ensure that all the packages have been updated correctly.

```
npm audit
```

If any vulnerable packages remain, you can manually update the packages to the latest version or contact the package maintainer to request an update.
