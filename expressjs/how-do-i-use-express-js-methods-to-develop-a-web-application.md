# How do I use Express.js methods to develop a web application?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that allows you to easily create web applications with minimal coding. You can use Express.js methods to develop a web application by following these steps:

1. Install Express.js by running `npm install express` in the command line.
2. Create an Express.js application by running `const app = express()` in the code.
3. Define routes with `app.get()` or `app.post()` methods.
4. Use the `app.use()` method to define middleware.
5. Use the `app.listen()` method to start the server.

## Example code

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

## Output example

```
Server started on port 3000
```
