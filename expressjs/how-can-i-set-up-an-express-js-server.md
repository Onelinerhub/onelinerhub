# How can I set up an Express.js server?
// plain

Setting up an Express.js server is a relatively straightforward process.

First, install the Express.js module using the node package manager (npm):

```
npm install express
```

Next, create a file for your server code such as `server.js` and include the following code:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!'));
```

This code will create an Express server on port 3000 and respond to requests with a simple "Hello World!" message.

When you're ready to run the server, use the following command:

```
node server.js
```

This will start the server and the following output should appear in the console:

```
Example app listening on port 3000!
```

The server is now running and ready to accept requests.
