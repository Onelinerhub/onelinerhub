# How can I set up caching in ExpressJS?
// plain

Setting up caching in ExpressJS is relatively straightforward and can be done with the help of the Express Caching middleware.

To begin, install the Express Caching middleware with the following command:

```
npm install express-cache-middleware
```

Once installed, the middleware can be used to enable caching by adding the following code to your Express application:

```
const cache = require('express-cache-middleware');

// Enable caching
app.use(cache());
```

The above code will enable caching for all routes in the Express application. To configure the caching options, you can pass an options object to the middleware. For example, to cache all requests for one minute:

```
app.use(cache({ ttl: 60 }));
```

The available options are:
- `ttl`: The time-to-live in seconds.
- `stale`: Allow requests to be served from the cache when it is expired.
- `ignoreQueryString`: Ignore query string parameters when caching.
- `ignoreHeaders`: An array of request headers to ignore when caching.

You can find more information about the Express Caching middleware in the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-cache-middleware).
