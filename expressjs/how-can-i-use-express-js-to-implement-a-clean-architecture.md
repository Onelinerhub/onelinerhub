# How can I use Express.js to implement a clean architecture?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that can be used to implement a clean architecture. A clean architecture is an approach to software design that separates the concerns of the application into layers and components.

The following example code shows how to use Express.js to create a clean architecture.

```
// Create an express app
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Create a router
const router = express.Router();

// Add routes to the router
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Render the response
  res.render('index');
});

// Attach the router to the express app
app.use('/', router);

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Output example

```
Server listening on port 3000
```

The code consists of the following parts:
1. Require the Express module and create an Express app.
2. Create a router and add routes to it.
3. Attach the router to the Express app.
4. Start the server.
