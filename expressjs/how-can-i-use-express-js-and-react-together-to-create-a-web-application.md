# How can I use Express.js and React together to create a web application?
// plain

The Express.js and React frameworks can be used together to create a web application. Express.js is a back-end framework that can be used to create a server and route requests, while React is a front-end library for creating user interfaces.

For example, the following code can be used to create a server with Express and render a React component:

```
const express = require('express');
const React = require('react');
const ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const component = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello World!');
  const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(component);
  res.send(html);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

This code will create a server on port 3000 and render an `h1` element with the text "Hello World!" when a request is made to the root route.

## Code explanation

- `const express = require('express')`: This line imports the Express.js framework.
- `const React = require('react')`: This line imports the React library.
- `const ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server')`: This line imports the ReactDOMServer library for server-side rendering of React components.
- `const app = express()`: This line creates an Express application.
- `app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... })`: This line creates a route handler for the root route.
- `const component = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello World!')`: This line creates a React component with an `h1` element and the text "Hello World!".
- `const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(component)`: This line renders the React component to a string.
- `res.send(html)`: This line sends the rendered HTML to the client.
- `app.listen(3000)`: This line starts the Express server on port 3000.
