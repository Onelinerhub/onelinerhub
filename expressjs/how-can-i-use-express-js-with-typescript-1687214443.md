# How can I use Express.js with TypeScript?
// plain

Express.js is a popular Node.js web application framework that can be used with TypeScript for creating web applications.

To use Express.js with TypeScript, you need to first install the necessary packages:

```
npm install express @types/express
```

Then, create a TypeScript file, such as `app.ts`:

```typescript
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started!');
});
```

Finally, compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript and run it:

```
tsc app.ts
node app.js
```

## Output example

```
Server started!
```

The code above is a basic example of how to use Express.js with TypeScript. It creates a web server that listens for requests on port 3000 and responds with "Hello World" when a request is made to the root path.

More information about using Express.js with TypeScript can be found in the [official Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.typescript) and the [TypeScript Express tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/express.html).
