# How do Express.js and Nest.js compare in terms of software development?
// plain

Express.js and Nest.js are both popular Node.js frameworks for developing web applications. They both provide a robust set of features for creating web applications, but there are some key differences between them.

Express.js is a minimalistic web framework, designed to provide a robust set of features for creating web applications. It is lightweight and easy to use, and provides a wide range of features, such as routing, middleware, and templating.

Nest.js, on the other hand, is a full-featured web framework, designed to provide a complete development environment for creating web applications. It is built on top of the popular TypeScript language, and provides a range of features, such as dependency injection, object-oriented programming, and an MVC architecture.

Example code using Express.js:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!'));
```

## Output example

```Example app listening on port 3000!```

## Code explanation

1. `const express = require('express');`: This line imports the Express.js module.
2. `const app = express();`: This line creates an Express.js application.
3. `app.get('/', (req, res) => {...});`: This line defines a route handler for the root path.
4. `app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!'));`: This line starts the server on port 3000.
