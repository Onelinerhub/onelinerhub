# How can I use Jest to test my Express.js application?
// plain

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that can be used to test an Express.js application. To get started, install Jest and its Express-compatible adapter, SuperTest.

```
npm install --save-dev jest supertest
```

Once installed, create a test file for your Express application. The following example uses `app.test.js` as the name of the file:

```
// app.test.js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./app');

describe('Test the root path', () => {
  test('It should response the GET method', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/');
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
  });
});
```

The code above imports the `request` method from the SuperTest package and the Express app from the `app.js` file. The `describe` and `test` methods are used to create a test suite and test case, respectively. The `request` method is used to make a request to the Express app, and the `expect` method is used to check the response status code.

To run the test, use the following command:

```
npm run test
```

The output should look something like this:

```
 PASS  app.test.js
  Test the root path
    âœ“ It should response the GET method (3ms)
