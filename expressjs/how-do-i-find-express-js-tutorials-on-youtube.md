### Example code

Here is an example of a simple Express.js application:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Listening on port 3000'));
```

### Output

When the code runs, the output will be:

```
Listening on port 3000
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `const express = require('express');`: This imports the Express.js library.
2. `const app = express();`: This initializes the Express.js application.
3. `app.get('/', (req, res) => {...})`: This is a route handler that defines what should happen when a GET request is sent to the root of the application.
4. `res.send('Hello World!');`: This sends a response with the text "Hello World!".
5. `app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Listening on port 3000'));`: This starts the application and listens for requests on port 3000.
