# How can I use Express.js to answer questions?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that can be used to answer questions. It provides a simple way to create web applications and APIs.

To use Express.js to answer questions, you can use the `app.get()` method to create routes that will respond to HTTP requests. For example, the following code creates a route that will respond to a GET request with a simple 

```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/answer', (req, res) => {
  res.send('The answer is 42')
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Listening on port 3000')
})
```

This code will create an Express.js server that responds to the `/answer` route with the response `The answer is 42`.

The main parts of the code are:

* `const express = require('express')`: This imports the Express.js module.
* `const app = express()`: This creates an Express.js application.
* `app.get('/answer', (req, res) => {`: This creates a route that responds to a GET request.
* `res.send('The answer is 42')`: This sends the response `The answer is 42` to the client.
* `app.listen(3000, () => {`: This starts the Express.js server on port 3000.
