# How can I configure ESLint to work with Express.js?
// plain

ESLint is a static code analysis tool used to identify and report on patterns found in JavaScript code. It can be used to detect errors, bugs, and suspicious code in your Express.js application.

To configure ESLint to work with Express.js, you will need to install the necessary packages and configure the ESLint rules.

1. Install the following packages:
    * `eslint`
    * `eslint-plugin-express`
2. Create a `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project and add the following configuration:
```
{
    "extends": [
        "plugin:express/recommended"
    ]
}
```
3. Run ESLint on your Express.js application with the following command:
```
$ eslint <path-to-app>
```

This will run ESLint and report any errors, bugs, or suspicious code it finds.
