# How can I host an Express.js application?
// plain

You can host an Express.js application using a Node.js server. You can use the following code to create a server and listen on port 3000:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```
The code above will create a simple Express.js application that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello World!" when the root URL is accessed.

The code consists of the following parts:
1. `const express = require('express');` - This line imports the Express.js module.
2. `const app = express();` - This line creates an Express.js application.
3. `app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... });` - This is a route handler that responds with "Hello World!" when the root URL is accessed.
4. `app.listen(3000, () => { ... });` - This line creates a server and listens on port 3000.
