// plain

Express.js and Babel can be used together to develop a web application. Express is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write code in the latest version of JavaScript and compile it into a version that is supported by most browsers.

To use Express.js and Babel together, the following steps should be taken:

1. Install Express.js:

```
$ npm install express
```

2. Install Babel:

```
$ npm install babel
```

3. Create a directory for the application:

```
$ mkdir my-app
```

4. Create an Express.js application:

```
$ express my-app
```

5. Install Babel dependencies:

```
$ cd my-app
$ npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

6. Create a `.babelrc` file in the root of the application:

```
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

7. Add Babel configuration to the `package.json` file:

```
"babel": {
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

Once these steps are complete, Express.js and Babel can be used together to develop a web application.
