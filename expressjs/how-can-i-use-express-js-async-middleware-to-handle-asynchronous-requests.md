# How can I use Express.js async middleware to handle asynchronous requests?
// plain

Express.js async middleware can be used to handle asynchronous requests. It allows asynchronous code to be written in a "promise-based" style, which makes it easier to work with.

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const result = await someAsyncFunction();
    res.send(result);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

The code above uses the Express.js async middleware to handle an asynchronous request. It calls `someAsyncFunction` and sends the result back in the response. If an error occurs, it is passed to the `next` function, which can be used to handle errors.

The code can be broken down as follows:

1. `const express = require('express');` - This imports the Express.js library.
2. `const app = express();` - This creates an Express.js application.
3. `app.use(async (req, res, next) => {` - This registers an async middleware function.
4. `const result = await someAsyncFunction();` - This calls an asynchronous function and waits for the result.
5. `res.send(result);` - This sends the result back in the response.
6. `next(error);` - This passes any errors to the next function.
7. `app.listen(3000);` - This starts the Express.js server.
