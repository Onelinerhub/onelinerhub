# How can I use Object-Oriented Programming principles with Express.js?
// plain

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles can be used in Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, to create more maintainable and extensible applications. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to store data and methods that manipulate the data. In Express.js, objects can be used to create routes, which are the endpoints of a web application.

For example, the following code creates a route that will respond to a GET request with a JSON object containing a message:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Create a route object
const myRoute = {
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/',
  handler: (req, res) => {
    res.json({
      message: 'Hello World!'
    });
  }
};

// Register the route
app.route(myRoute);

app.listen(3000);
```

The `myRoute` object contains the method (`GET`), path (`/`), and handler (a function that will be called when the route is requested) for the route. This object can then be passed to the `app.route()` method to register the route.

By using objects to define routes, it is easier to maintain and extend the application. For example, more routes can be added by creating additional objects and passing them to `app.route()`.
