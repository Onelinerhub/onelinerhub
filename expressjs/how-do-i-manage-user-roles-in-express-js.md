# How do I manage user roles in Express.js?
// plain

User roles in Express.js can be managed using a combination of middleware and authorization checks.

A middleware can be used to check a user's role and assign them the appropriate permissions. For example, the following code block uses the [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt) middleware to check a user's role and decide whether they are allowed access to a route:

```javascript
// Check the user's role
app.use(jwt({
  secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  algorithms: ['HS256'],
  getToken: req => req.query.token
}).unless({
  path: ['/public']
}));

// Assign the appropriate permissions
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user && req.user.role === 'admin') {
    req.user.isAdmin = true;
  }
  next();
});
```

Once the middleware is set up, authorization checks can be used to ensure that users are only able to access routes that they are allowed to. For example, the following code block uses an `if` statement to check if the user is an admin before allowing them access to a route:

```javascript
app.get('/admin', (req, res) => {
  if (req.user && req.user.isAdmin) {
    res.send('Welcome, Admin!');
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('You are not allowed to access this route.');
  }
});
```

In this example:

- `jwt` is used to check the user's role and assign them the appropriate permissions.
- An `if` statement is used to check if the user is an admin before allowing them access to a route.
