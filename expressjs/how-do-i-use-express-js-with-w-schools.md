# How do I use Express.js with W3Schools?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, allowing developers to create dynamic web applications. Express.js can be used with W3Schools to create a web application that can be accessed by users.

Below is an example of how to use Express.js with W3Schools:

```
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

The code above creates an Express.js application that listens on port 3000. When a request is made to the root path (`/`), the response will be `Hello World!`.

## Code explanation


1. `var express = require('express');` - This line imports the Express.js module.
2. `var app = express();` - This line creates an Express.js application.
3. `app.get('/', function (req, res) {` - This line creates a route handler for the root path (`/`).
4. `res.send('Hello World!');` - This line sends the response `Hello World!` when the root path is requested.
5. `app.listen(3000);` - This line starts the Express.js application and listens on port 3000.
