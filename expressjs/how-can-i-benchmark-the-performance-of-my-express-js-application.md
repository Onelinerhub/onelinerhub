# How can I benchmark the performance of my Express.js application?
// plain

Benchmarking the performance of an Express.js application involves measuring the various aspects of the application including the speed and response time of requests, the memory usage, and the overall throughput of the application.

To benchmark the performance of an Express.js application, one can use a tool such as [Apache Bench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) to measure the speed and response time of requests.

## Example code

```
$ ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:3000/
```

Example output:
```
Server Software:        Express
Server Hostname:        localhost
Server Port:            3000

Document Path:          /
Document Length:        12 bytes

Concurrency Level:      10
Time taken for tests:   0.813 seconds
Complete requests:      1000
Failed requests:        0
Total transferred:      172000 bytes
HTML transferred:       12000 bytes
Requests per second:    1226.77 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       81.267 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       8.127 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          208.08 [Kbytes/sec] received

Connection Times (ms)
              min  mean[+/-sd] median   max
Connect:        0    0   0.5      0       2
Processing:    14   81  32.3     76     148
Waiting:       14   81  32.3     76     148
Total:         14   81  32.3     76     148

Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
  50%     76
  66%     88
  75%     96
  80%    100
  90%    115
  95%    131
  98%    144
  99%    146
 100%    148 (longest request)
```

The output of the example code shows the time taken for the tests, the number of requests sent, the requests per second, and the time per request. The output also includes the connection times and the percentage of requests served within a certain time.

In addition to Apache Bench, there are other tools available to benchmark the performance of an Express.js application such as [Artillery](https://artillery.io/), [Load Impact](https://loadimpact.com/), and [Siege](https://www.joedog.org/siege-home/).
