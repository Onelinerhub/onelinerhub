# How can I add an Express.js logo in SVG format to my website?
// plain

To add an Express.js logo in SVG format to your website, you will need to include the following code snippet in your HTML file:

```HTML
<img src="https://expressjs.com/images/express-facebook-share.png" alt="Express.js Logo" />
```

This code will load the Express.js logo in SVG format from the provided URL.

The code consists of the following parts:

- `<img>` - the HTML tag used to embed an image
- `src="https://expressjs.com/images/express-facebook-share.png"` - the URL of the Express.js logo
- `alt="Express.js Logo"` - the alternative text for the logo

You can find more information on embedding images in HTML on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML).
