# How do I set up the file structure for an Express.js application?
// plain

The file structure for an Express.js application is composed of three main parts: the application directory, the public directory, and the routes directory.

The application directory contains the main configuration files, such as the `package.json` and the `app.js` files. The `package.json` file contains the project's dependencies and scripts, while the `app.js` file contains the main application code.

The public directory contains all the static assets, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

The routes directory contains all the files that define the application's routes. Each route file will contain the route definition and the logic for that route.

For example, the `index.js` file in the routes directory might look like this:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the Express.js application!');
});

module.exports = router;
```

The output of the above code would be:

```
Welcome to the Express.js application!
```
