# How can I use Docker to deploy an Express.js application?
// plain

1. Create a `Dockerfile` for your Express.js application. This should include instructions to install any dependencies, copy the application code into the container, and set the working directory.

```
FROM node:12-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

2. Build the Docker image from the `Dockerfile` using the `docker build` command.

```
docker build -t express-app .
```

3. Run the image as a container using the `docker run` command.

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 express-app
```

4. Your Express.js application should now be running on port 3000 of your Docker host.

5. To deploy to a production environment, you can push the image to a Docker registry and use a container orchestrator such as Kubernetes to manage the deployment.

6. You can also use Docker Compose to define and run multiple containers for your application.

7. For more information, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and the [Express.js deployment guide](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/deployment.html).
