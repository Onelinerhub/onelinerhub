# How do I install Express.js?
// plain

Installing Express.js is a very simple process. It can be done using the ```npm install express``` command in the command line. This command will install the latest version of Express.js.

Once the installation is complete, you can create a simple Express.js app using the following code:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```
This code will create a simple web server that will listen on port 3000 and respond to requests with the message "Hello World!".

The main parts of the code are:
* `const express = require('express');` - This line imports the Express.js module.
* `const app = express();` - This line creates an Express.js application.
* `app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... })` - This line creates a route that will respond to requests with the message "Hello World!".
* `app.listen(3000, () => { ... })` - This line tells the server to listen on port 3000.
