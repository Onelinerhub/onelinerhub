# How do I use Express.js to handle asynchronous requests?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that is used to build web applications and APIs. It can be used to handle asynchronous requests by using the `async` and `await` keywords.

For example, the following code block uses Express.js to handle an asynchronous request:

```javascript
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  const result = await doSomethingAsync();
  res.send(result);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

In this example, the `async` keyword is used to indicate that the function passed to `app.get` is asynchronous. The `await` keyword is then used to wait for the result of the `doSomethingAsync` function before sending it back as the response.

## Code explanation


* `const express = require("express");` - This line imports the Express.js module.
* `const app = express();` - This line creates an Express.js application instance.
* `app.get("/", async (req, res) => {...});` - This line sets up a route handler for the `GET` request at the root path. The `async` keyword indicates that the function passed to `app.get` is asynchronous.
* `const result = await doSomethingAsync();` - This line waits for the result of the `doSomethingAsync` function and stores it in the `result` variable.
* `res.send(result);` - This line sends the `result` back as the response.
* `app.listen(3000);` - This line starts the Express.js server on port 3000.
