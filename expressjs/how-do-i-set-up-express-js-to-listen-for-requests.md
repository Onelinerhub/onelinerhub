# How do I set up Express.js to listen for requests?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It can be used to set up a server to listen for requests. To set up Express.js to listen for requests, you need to first install the Express.js package. This can be done using the command `npm install express`.

Once the package is installed, you need to create an Express.js application. This can be done by creating a file and requiring the Express.js package. An example of this is shown below:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

After the Express.js application is created, you need to set it to listen for requests on a specific port. This can be done using the `app.listen` method. An example of this is shown below:

```
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

This will set the Express.js application to listen for requests on port 3000.

### Code parts

- `const express = require('express')`: This line requires the Express.js package.
- `const app = express()`: This line creates an Express.js application.
- `app.listen(3000, () => { ... })`: This line sets the Express.js application to listen for requests on port 3000.
