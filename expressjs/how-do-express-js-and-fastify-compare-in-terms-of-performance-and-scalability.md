# How do Express.js and Fastify compare in terms of performance and scalability?
// plain

Express.js and Fastify are both popular Node.js frameworks for building web applications. They both offer performance and scalability, but they differ in the way they are implemented.

Express.js is a mature framework and has been around for a while. It is based on the Connect middleware architecture and is relatively easy to use. It is highly extensible and provides a powerful set of features. However, Express.js can be slow when dealing with large amounts of data, and its scalability is limited.

Fastify, on the other hand, is a relatively new framework. It is designed to be fast and efficient, and it is built on top of the native Node.js HTTP server. Fastify is optimized for speed and scalability, and it is capable of handling large amounts of data with ease.

In terms of performance and scalability, Fastify is the clear winner. It is faster than Express.js and can handle more requests and data.

## Example code

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

## Output example

```
Server listening on port 3000
```

## Code explanation

- `const express = require('express');` - imports the Express.js module
- `const app = express();` - creates an Express.js application
- `app.get('/', (req, res) => {` - defines a route handler for the root URL
- `res.send('Hello World!');` - sends a response to the client
- `app.listen(3000, () => {` - starts the server on port 3000
- `console.log('Server listening on port 3000');` - prints a message to the console
