How do I find online tutorials for Express.js?
// plain

Express.js is a popular web development framework for Node.js. To find online tutorials for Express.js, you can search for them on websites such as YouTube, Udemy, and Pluralsight. Additionally, you can find tutorials on the official Express.js website. Here is an example of a basic Express.js server:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

The code above creates an Express.js server that listens on port 3000 and responds with “Hello World!” when a request is made to the root path. The code consists of the following parts:

1. `const express = require('express');`: This imports the Express.js module.
2. `const app = express();`: This creates an Express.js application object.
3. `app.get('/', (req, res) => {...});`: This defines a handler for GET requests to the root path.
4. `res.send('Hello World!');`: This sends the response “Hello World!”.
5. `app.listen(3000, () => {...});`: This starts the server and listens on port 3000.
