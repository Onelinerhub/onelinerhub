# How can I use Express.js to develop a web application?
// plain

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building single and multi-page web applications. To use Express.js to develop a web application, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Express.js: `npm install express`
2. Create an Express.js app:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```

3. Define routes for your application:

```javascript
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World')
})
```

4. Start the server: `app.listen(3000)`
5. Open the application in a browser: `http://localhost:3000`

The output of the code in step 3 will be `Hello World` when the application is opened in a browser.
