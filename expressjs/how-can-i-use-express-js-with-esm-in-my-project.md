# How can I use Express.js with ESM in my project?
// plain

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It is used to create APIs, web applications, and server-side applications. ESM (ECMAScript Modules) is a language-level module system that enables developers to use import and export statements in their code.

To use Express.js with ESM in a project, the following steps should be taken:

1. Install the `esm` package:
```
npm install esm
```

2. Create a `index.js` file and import the `express` package:
```js
import express from 'express';
```

3. Create an instance of the `express` application:
```js
const app = express();
```

4. Add routes to the application:
```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});
```

5. Start the server:
```js
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
});
```

6. Run the project with the `esm` package:
```
node -r esm index.js
```

The output should be:
```
Server is listening on port 3000
```

This is the basic setup for using Express.js with ESM in a project. For more information, please refer to the following links:
