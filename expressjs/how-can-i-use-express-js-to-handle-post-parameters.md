# How can I use Express.js to handle POST parameters?
// plain

Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js that makes it easy to handle POST parameters. It can be used to create routes that accept POST requests and extract the parameters from the request body.

For example, the following code block creates a route that accepts a POST request and logs the parameters sent with the request:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
});
```

The `req.body` property in the above code block contains the POST parameters sent with the request.

In addition to extracting the parameters from the request body, Express.js also provides several other features for handling POST requests such as validating the parameters, setting response status codes, and sending response data.
