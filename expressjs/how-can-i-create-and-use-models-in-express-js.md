# How can I create and use models in Express.js?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It is used to create and use models in Node.js applications. Models are used to store and manipulate data in an application.

To create and use models in Express.js, you need to install a database adapter such as Mongoose. Mongoose is an Object Document Mapper (ODM) that provides a schema-based solution to model your application data.

Once Mongoose is installed, you can define a model as follows:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

This code defines a model called `User` with two fields, `name` and `age`.

You can then use the model to create, read, update, and delete data from the database. For example, to create a new user:

```javascript
const newUser = new User({ name: 'John', age: 25 });
newUser.save();
```

This code creates a new user object and saves it to the database.
