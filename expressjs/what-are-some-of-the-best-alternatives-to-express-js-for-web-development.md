1. Koa.js: Koa.js is a modern web framework for Node.js. It is built by the same team that created Express.js. Koa.js provides a more robust and expressive API for writing web applications. It is also more modular and lightweight.

## Example code

```
const Koa = require('koa')
const app = new Koa()

app.use(async ctx => {
  ctx.body = 'Hello World'
})

app.listen(3000)
```

2. Hapi.js: Hapi.js is a rich framework for building applications and services. It offers a plugin system for extending the core functionality. It also provides a robust set of features such as input validation, authentication, and caching.

## Example code

```
const Hapi = require('hapi')

const server = Hapi.server({
  port: 3000,
  host: 'localhost'
})

server.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/',
  handler: (request, h) => {
    return 'Hello World!'
  }
})

await server.start()
console.log('Server running at:', server.info.uri)
```

3. Sails.js: Sails.js is a popular MVC framework for Node.js. It is modeled after the popular Ruby on Rails framework. It provides a robust set of features such as data modeling, controllers, views, and services.

## Example code

```
// config/routes.js
module.exports.routes = {
  '/': {
    view: 'homepage'
  }
};

// views/homepage.ejs
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

4. Nest.js: Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It is built with TypeScript and combines elements of OOP, FP, and FRP.

## Example code

```
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('hello')
export class HelloController {
  @Get()
  root(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

5. Meteor.js: Meteor.js is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. It is based on the Node.js runtime and provides a powerful set of features such as real-time data synchronization, a reactive programming model, and an integrated build system.

## Example code

```
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';

Meteor.startup(() => {
  console.log('Hello World!');
});
```

6. Feathers.js: Feathers.js is a real-time, micro-service web framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features such as REST and websocket APIs, authentication, and real-time data synchronization.

## Example code

```
const feathers = require('@feathersjs/feathers');
const express = require('@feathersjs/express');

const app = express(feathers());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello World!' });
});

app.listen(3000);
```
