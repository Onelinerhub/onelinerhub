How can I decide between Express.js and Koa for a software development project?
// plain

When deciding between Express.js and Koa for a software development project, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Functionality**: Express.js is a full-featured web development framework, while Koa is a more minimalistic framework that requires additional middleware to provide many of the features that Express provides out-of-the-box.

2. **Performance**: Koa is built on top of modern JavaScript and is more lightweight than Express, which can result in improved performance in certain cases.

3. **Error Handling**: Koa provides better error handling capabilities than Express, allowing developers to easily handle errors in the middleware layer.

4. **API**: Express provides a more comprehensive API than Koa, which can be beneficial for developers looking to quickly build out a feature-rich application.

5. **Learning Curve**: Express generally has a lower learning curve than Koa, as it provides more features out of the box.

6. **Community**: Express is a more established framework with a larger community of developers, so it tends to have more resources available for developers.

7. **Example Code**: Here is an example of a basic Koa app that prints "Hello World" to the console:

```
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = new Koa();

app.use(ctx => {
  console.log('Hello World');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Output example
 `Hello World`

Ultimately, the decision between Express.js and Koa for a software development project will depend on the specific needs of the project.
