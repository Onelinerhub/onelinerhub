# How do I use Express.js and Yarn together in a software development project?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, and Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript. They can be used together in a software development project to create a web application.

Below is an example of how to use Express.js and Yarn together in a project.

1. Create a project directory:
```
mkdir myproject
```

2. Change into the project directory:
```
cd myproject
```

3. Initialize the project with Yarn:
```
yarn init
```

4. Install Express.js with Yarn:
```
yarn add express
```

5. Create an app.js file in the project root with the following code:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```

6. Start the Express.js server with Yarn:
```
yarn start
```
## Output example

`Example app listening on port 3000!`

7. Visit http://localhost:3000 in a web browser to view the app.
