How can I use Express.js to create an isomorphic application?
// plain

An isomorphic application is a web application that can run on both the client-side and the server-side. Express.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications, and it can be used to create an isomorphic application.

The basic idea is to render the initial page on the server-side using Express.js, and then use client-side JavaScript to make further requests to the server. This allows the application to be rendered on both the client-side and the server-side.

Here is an example of how to use Express.js to create an isomorphic application:

```javascript
// server-side code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index.html');
});

app.listen(3000);

// client-side code
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', '/');
xhr.onload = () => {
  document.body.innerHTML = xhr.responseText;
}
xhr.send();
```

This code will render the `index.html` page on the server-side using Express.js, and then use an XMLHttpRequest to make a request to the server and render the response on the client-side.

The code consists of two parts:

1. **Server-side code**: This code uses the `express` module to create an Express.js application, and then defines a route for the `/` path which renders the `index.html` page. The application is then started on port 3000.

2. **Client-side code**: This code uses the XMLHttpRequest API to make a request to the server and render the response on the client-side.
