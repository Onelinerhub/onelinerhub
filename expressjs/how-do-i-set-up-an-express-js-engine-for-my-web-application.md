// plain

Setting up an Express.js engine for your web application is a relatively simple process.

1. Install the Express.js module:
```
$ npm install express
```

2. Create a `server.js` file in the root of your project directory.

3. Require the Express.js module in the `server.js` file:
```
const express = require('express');
```

4. Create an instance of Express.js in the `server.js` file:
```
const app = express();
```

5. Set up routes and middleware in the `server.js` file.

6. Set the port for the server to listen on:
```
const port = 3000;
```

7. Start the server:
```
app.listen(port);
```

You should now have a basic Express.js engine set up for your web application.
