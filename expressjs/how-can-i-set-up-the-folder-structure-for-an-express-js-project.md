# How can I set up the folder structure for an Express.js project?
// plain

A typical Express.js project folder structure should include the following:

1. `bin/` - Contains the startup scripts and any other scripts related to the project.

2. `config/` - Contains any configuration files related to the project.

3. `public/` - Contains static assets such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.

4. `routes/` - Contains the route definitions for the project.

5. `views/` - Contains the view templates for the project.

6. `app.js` - The main entry point for the application.

7. `package.json` - Contains the project's dependencies and configuration.

For example, the following code block shows the folder structure of a typical Express.js project:

```
my-express-project
├── bin
├── config
├── public
├── routes
├── views
├── app.js
└── package.json
```

No output is generated from this code block.
