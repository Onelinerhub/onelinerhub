# How do I create an Express.js logo?
// plain

To create an Express.js logo, you can use the popular vector graphics editor Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator allows you to create and manipulate vector graphics, which are images that can be scaled without losing quality.

To get started, open up Illustrator and create a new document by going to `File > New`. Then, draw the logo elements that you want. For example, if you want to create an Express.js logo, you can draw a train engine, tracks, and a steam cloud. Once you are done drawing, you can use the `Object > Path > Outline Stroke` command to convert the lines into shapes.

You can also add color to your logo by using the `Window > Color` palette. Select the colors that you want to use and then click and drag them onto the logo elements.

Finally, you can export your logo as an image file by going to `File > Export > Export As`. Choose the file type that you want to use and then click `Export`.

Here's an example of the code you might use to create an Express.js logo:

```
// Create a new document
File > New

// Draw the logo elements
Draw train engine, tracks, and steam cloud

// Convert lines into shapes
Object > Path > Outline Stroke

// Add colors
Window > Color

// Export the logo
File > Export > Export As
```
