1. **What is Express.js?**
Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is used to create server-side applications and APIs.

2. **What are the main features of Express.js?**
The main features of Express.js include routing, middleware, template engines, and database integration. It also provides support for various databases, such as MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis.

3. **What is a middleware in Express.js?**
Middleware in Express.js is a function that is invoked when a request is made to the server. It is used to perform operations on the request and response objects before they are sent to the next middleware or route handler.

## Example

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// A middleware function
function logger(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
}

app.use(logger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

## Output example

```
GET /
Server started on port 3000
```

4. **What is a template engine in Express.js?**
A template engine in Express.js is a library that allows you to generate HTML dynamically from data. It is used to create webpages from data stored in the backend.

## Example

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Set view engine
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Render the index.ejs template
  res.render('index', {
    title: 'Express App',
    message: 'Hello World!'
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

5. **What is routing in Express.js?**
Routing in Express.js is the process of mapping URLs to callback functions (also known as controller functions). It is used to define the behavior of an application when a client makes a request to a particular URL.

## Example

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home page');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About page');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

6. **What is database integration in Express.js?**
Database integration in Express.js is the process of connecting an application to a database. It is used to store and retrieve data from a database.

## Example

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mysql = require('mysql');
const app = express();

// Create connection
const db = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'mydatabase'
});

// Connect
db.connect((err) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  console.log('MySQL connected...');
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  let sql = 'SELECT * FROM posts';
  let query = db.query(sql, (err, results) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(results);
    res.send('Posts fetched...');
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

## Output example

```
MySQL connected...
[ { id: 1, title: 'Post One', body: 'This is post one' },
  { id: 2, title: 'Post Two', body: 'This is post two' } ]
Posts fetched...
```
