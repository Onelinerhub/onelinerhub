# How do I set the keepalivetimeout in Express.js?
// plain

Setting the keepalivetimeout in Express.js is a simple process. To do so, you must have your Express server running and you must use the `server.setTimeout()` method. This method takes two arguments, the number of milliseconds to wait before timing out the connection and a callback function that is executed when the timeout is reached. Here is an example:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const server = app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

server.setTimeout(5000, () => {
  console.log('Connection timed out');
});
```

The output of this code will be `Server is running on port 3000` and after 5 seconds, `Connection timed out` will be printed.

## Code explanation

- `const express = require('express');` - This line imports the Express library.
- `const app = express();` - This line creates an Express application.
- `const server = app.listen(3000, () => {` - This line starts the server on port 3000.
- `server.setTimeout(5000, () => {` - This line sets the keepalivetimeout to 5 seconds.
- `console.log('Connection timed out');` - This line prints out the message when the timeout is reached.
