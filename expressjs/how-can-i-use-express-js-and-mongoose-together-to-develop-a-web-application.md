# How can I use Express.js and Mongoose together to develop a web application?
// plain

Express.js and Mongoose can be used together to develop a web application by combining the two frameworks. Express.js is used to create a web server and handle HTTP requests, while Mongoose provides a layer of abstraction for the MongoDB database.

## Example

```
// Require Mongoose
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Connect to the MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/myapp');

// Require Express
const express = require('express');

// Create an Express application
const app = express();

// Set up the routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

## Output example

```
Server listening on port 3000
```

The code above sets up a basic Express server with a single route. First, Mongoose is required and used to connect to the MongoDB database. Then Express is required and an Express application is created. Finally, the routes are set up and the server is started.

Parts of the Code:
- `const mongoose = require('mongoose');`: This line requires the mongoose module.
- `mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/myapp');`: This line connects to the MongoDB database.
- `const express = require('express');`: This line requires the express module.
- `const app = express();`: This line creates an Express application.
- `app.get('/', (req, res) => {`: This line sets up a route for the root path.
- `app.listen(3000, () => {`: This line starts the server on port 3000.
