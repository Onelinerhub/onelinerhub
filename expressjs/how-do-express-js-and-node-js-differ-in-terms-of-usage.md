# How do Express.js and Node.js differ in terms of usage?
// plain

Express.js and Node.js are both JavaScript-based technologies used for creating web applications. While Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment used for executing JavaScript code server-side, Express.js is a web application framework built on Node.js for creating web applications and APIs.

Node.js is used mainly for developing server-side applications, while Express.js is used to create the server and route requests to the appropriate resources. Node.js provides a basic server-side platform for running JavaScript code, while Express.js provides additional features and functionality that makes it easier to create web applications.

**Example code block**

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```

**Output**

```
Example app listening on port 3000!
```

**List of code parts with detailed explanation**

- `const express = require('express');`: This line imports the Express.js module.
- `const app = express();`: This creates an Express.js application.
- `app.get('/', (req, res) => {`: This sets up a route handler for the root path.
- `res.send('Hello World!');`: This sends a response with the message "Hello World!".
- `app.listen(3000, () => {`: This starts the server on port 3000.
- `console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');`: This logs a message to the console.
