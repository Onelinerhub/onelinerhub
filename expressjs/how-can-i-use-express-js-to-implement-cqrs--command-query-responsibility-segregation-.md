# How can I use Express.js to implement CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)?
// plain

Express.js is a powerful web application framework for Node.js that can be used to implement CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation). CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates read and write operations into two distinct models.

Here's an example of how to use Express.js to implement CQRS:

```
// Create two separate Express.js routers for read and write operations
const readRouter = express.Router();
const writeRouter = express.Router();

// Set up read and write routes
readRouter.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Perform read operations
});

writeRouter.post('/', (req, res) => {
  // Perform write operations
});

// Mount the routers
app.use('/read', readRouter);
app.use('/write', writeRouter);
```

This example creates two separate Express.js routers for read and write operations. The `/read` route is used for read operations, and the `/write` route is used for write operations.
