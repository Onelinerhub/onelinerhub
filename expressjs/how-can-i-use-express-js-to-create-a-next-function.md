# How can I use Express.js to create a next function?
// plain

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of creating server-side applications. It can be used to create a next function, which is a function that is called at the end of a request-response cycle.

## Example code

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('This is the next function!');
  next();
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));
```

## Output example

```
Server started on port 3000
```

The code consists of the following parts:

1. `const express = require('express');` - This imports the Express module.
2. `const app = express();` - This creates an Express application.
3. `app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.send('Hello World!'); });` - This creates a route handler for the root path that sends a response with the text “Hello World!”.
4. `app.use((req, res, next) => { console.log('This is the next function!'); next(); });` - This creates a middleware function that logs a message and then calls the `next()` function to continue the request-response cycle.
5. `app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));` - This starts the server on port 3000.
